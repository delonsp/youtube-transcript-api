1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
because the difference has turned out to

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,919
be greater than anything ever published.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,559
So, I want to make sure to point out

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
this is not yet a peer-reviewed paper.

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,320
It will come out as a peer-reviewed p

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,320
paper later this year, but the results

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,640
are so striking that we want people to

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
be aware of them because there really is

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,080
something that can be done now for

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
cognitive decline as we've all been

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,760
seeing now for over 10 years. But this

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,679
was the best proof yet in the trial. So

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,160
let me start. Uh Kat, you are the

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,840
trialist among the group of the six

15
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,239
sites, the one who has the most

16
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
experience with trials and I know you've

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,960
conducted over the years something like

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,360
a hundred. Um tell me how many of the

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,719
trials that you've done in the past led

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,920
to cognitive improvement.

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,559
Well, some of them did. I did all of the

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,760
first generation of Alzheimer medication

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,199
trials before the new anti-analoid drugs

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,119
and some of them like Aerys did have

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,439
some improvement but it didn't last

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,320
beyond a year. So you could have you

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,799
know a mild improvement but it wasn't

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,799
sustained. And one of the thing and then

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
then I actually did a study with one of

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
the first anti-amaloid drugs years ago

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,600
and we showed that that drug could wipe

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
out the amaloid plaques but it did not

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,560
translate to clinical improvement. So

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,759
that drug never made it onto the market.

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:32,400
So um so yeah, this is quite exciting to

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,560
be involved in these two trials where we

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,280
don't just slow things down, but we

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,400
actually reverse what's happening by

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,079
addressing all of the underlying causes.

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,000
And that's that's the difference. I mean

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,240
maybe medications can reduce amaloid

42
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,320
plaques, but the process will keep going

43
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,000
if you don't deal with the underlying

44
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,520
drivers of the disease.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah, you made an important point which

46
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,720
is sustainability. And so as you know

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,399
Dr. Schneider from USC has published a

48
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,079
paper saying what about the follow-ups

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,240
on people who went on Aeris and

50
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
unfortunately in the long run they did

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,560
worse than people who weren't treated at

52
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,720
all. So you're really essentially

53
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,200
pushing things up to the front. You're

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,160
frontloading but in the long run it's

55
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,840
actually hurting you unfortunately. On

56
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,160
the other hand you know we've published

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,640
a paper showing people who even over 10

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,120
years continue to have sustained

59
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
improvement. And so actually let me ask

60
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
you an in your patients who've been

61
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,680
treated for several years are you seeing

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,239
sustained improvements

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,280
in the patients who continue to follow

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
the protocol and not everyone does of

65
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,480
course

66
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
right

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,360
um but in the patients who continue to

68
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,319
follow the protocol we see sustained

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,040
improvement improvement that you know

70
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,239
not not just stabilizes but they

71
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,040
continue to improve you know not not

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,360
really my patient personally, but Judy

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,200
Benjamin is an incredible example of

74
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,080
that. You know, not part of the study,

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,599
but

76
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,360
just an amazing uh an amazing result.

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,120
We're seeing this again and again, and I

78
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,599
just got an email from one of the people

79
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,239
who's now been on eight years, and her

80
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,000
scores are still going up. Uh her latest

81
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,920
scores are better. Even though she was

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,360
into the normal years ago, she's

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,239
actually still getting better with her

84
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,480
scores. So, that's that's great to see.

85
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,720
So, let's talk about the the trial

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,959
that's just been completed. Uh we'll

87
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,480
have a paper coming out uh in the next

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,840
several months as I mentioned, but

89
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,319
meanwhile there is a free posted online

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,120
preprint that you can see that describes

91
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,760
all the details and summar summarizes uh

92
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,239
what we saw in this trial. So, this was

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,319
a randomized control trial. It was

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,640
carried out at six different sites

95
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,159
around um and you can see it on

96
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,560
clinicaltrials.gov.

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,840
So it is part of the the government

98
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,920
online description of trials. Um it it

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,959
was nine months. So people were

100
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,000
randomized either to group A which was

101
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:03,120
the precision medicine protocol or to

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,120
group B which was standard of care. And

103
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,519
essentially that meant going back to

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,439
their PCP or their neurologist and

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,760
having them do what they usually do,

106
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,760
which I think is actually a good idea

107
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,519
because we're all I think we've all been

108
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,600
impressed with the fact that there's not

109
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,320
a lot of treatment going on out there.

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,720
There is some aerosept being used often.

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
Um but in general, people aren't doing a

112
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
lot and they're telling people, well,

113
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,759
you're not that bad yet, you know, come

114
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,680
back later. That sort of thing. And I've

115
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,520
been horrified to see the sort of

116
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
treatment that people are getting. In

117
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,960
fact, our control group was very similar

118
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,160
to the control group that was in some of

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,000
the other trials that have been

120
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,320
published. So, I think it's good. It

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,040
helps us to match up with those trials.

122
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,199
Also the degree of impairment was

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,240
similar to other trials in that these

124
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,440
were people who had MCI was the MCI

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,840
stage or early dementia stage that is to

126
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,600
say mocha scores of 18 or higher but

127
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,680
with symptoms and with AQ21s. In other

128
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,000
words, their partners had noticed that

129
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,039
they were having problems as well. So

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,280
for multiple different uh different

131
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,199
analyses it was clear that there was

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
impairment going on from symptoms from

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,919
partners from their test scores all

134
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,440
those sorts of things. Uh and then these

135
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
were people who were treated for nine

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,240
months and then looking at during that

137
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
time what happened to their cognition,

138
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
what happened to their epigenetics, what

139
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,560
happened to their biochemistry, what

140
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,160
happened to their physiology, all these

141
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:37,280
sorts of things. Uh and so when we look

142
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,759
at the end here, the striking thing was

143
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,440
that the difference between the group

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,680
that was in the control group that

145
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,680
continue to go downhill with their

146
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,400
memory, downhill with their overall

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,199
cognitive scores versus the ones treated

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
by Dr. Hathaway, Dr. Tups, um and the

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,840
other four physicians um that I'll

150
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,080
mention here, Dr. Craig Tanio, uh Dr.

151
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,440
Christine Burke, Dr. Nate Bergman, Dr.

152
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,039
David Hos uh all together those six

153
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,680
sites um as an average they went up up

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,600
up uh through the nine months. Very

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
striking. So they had improvements in

156
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
their overall cognition. They had

157
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,080
improvements in their composite memory

158
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
scores. They had improvements in their

159
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,560
executive function. They had

160
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,240
improvements in their processing speed.

161
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,400
Really striking. They had improvements

162
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
in their symptoms. Their partners

163
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,680
noticed the improvement. This wasn't one

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,360
of these things where it was so small

165
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
that the partners didn't even notice it,

166
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,240
which has happened in other trials in

167
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,199
the past. These were clearly noticeable

168
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,840
by the partners. So, by all criteria,

169
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,479
these people were clearly better. Now,

170
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,520
some much better, some a little better,

171
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,000
but by all criteria, they were better.

172
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,560
So, I think it's helpful sometimes to

173
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
have an illustrative case or two. Um,

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,639
Kat, can you mention I know you you in

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,960
your I should mention in all your group,

176
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,280
every single treated patient got better.

177
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,599
That's unheard of in the Alzheimer's

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,039
field. So, congratulations for that. Can

179
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:08,240
you mention just one case as an example?

180
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:11,199
Sure. And and let me say with every

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,440
every patient getting better, um, all

182
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
but one of my patients tested in a

183
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,720
completely normal range by the end of

184
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
the study. And I had people that started

185
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,599
with mild Alzheimer's and then you know

186
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,360
some with MCI but you know even those

187
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,880
down to most of 20 21. So we had people

188
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,080
coming from a place of very clear

189
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,160
impairment into complete normalization.

190
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,160
Now do they have further to go? Sure. As

191
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,400
as uh Ann mentioned you know people can

192
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
still keep getting better and better.

193
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,039
And one thing I wanted to say was by

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,440
doing the full court press we worked

195
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,840
fast and furious because we only had

196
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,560
nine months to move the needle. But what

197
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,880
I saw in my cohort is a lot of people by

198
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,680
three months had already made phenomenal

199
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,759
gains. And so, you know, if you if

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,479
you're working with everything at once,

201
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,240
which is what we did, um, and give

202
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,759
people the proper support, they can

203
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,919
shift so quickly. So um I and my one

204
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,479
patient that didn't test completely

205
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,720
normal I would mention was still working

206
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,360
on resolving mold issues in her home

207
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,440
which we know is a neurotoxin and causes

208
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,759
degeneration in the brain but she

209
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,160
doubled her scores on her CNS vital

210
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,960
signs neuroscychiatric battery. So she

211
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,199
was still clearly improving. Um, I have

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,400
one patient that is is such an

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240
interesting story because, um, not only

214
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,039
did everything normalize for him

215
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,159
cognitively. I mean, he scored a perfect

216
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:39,279
score on his mocha at one point, but it

217
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,839
also, um, resolved all of his medical

218
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,240
and physical issues as well. This

219
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
gentleman was scheduled to have three

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
different joint replacements. He told me

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,080
he could barely get up the stairs. He

222
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,640
had to walk sideways and hold on because

223
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
he had so much pain. Guess what? All

224
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,800
those joints are normal now. He has no

225
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
more pain. He doesn't need surgeries,

226
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:02,640
joint replacement surgeries. What a a

227
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,279
wonderful um side effect of our study.

228
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,080
He also had autoimmune disease. He had

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,720
my gravis which is a pretty serious

230
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,880
autoimmune disease and basically we

231
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,959
resolved all the symptoms of those and I

232
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,399
was watching his antibbody levels come

233
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,720
down um because of the treatment. Um, I

234
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
believe we uh, you know, got them off of

235
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,959
blood pressure medicines. And so, you

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
know, the exciting thing is not only

237
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,760
what we're doing is is turning around

238
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,560
the cognition and helping people, you

239
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,160
know, to to reclaim their their brain

240
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,160
and their cognitive function, but it

241
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
helps everything else because, of

242
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,200
course, that's the whole premise of what

243
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,680
we do, right? Everything's connected.

244
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,720
The brain is connected to the body. So,

245
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,519
as we address all of these drivers, they

246
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,800
all help the brain and vice versa. Yeah,

247
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,720
you know, you brought up a really good

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,519
point, which is that people get better

249
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,800
not just cognitively, but actually in

250
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,279
the trial, we saw improved statistically

251
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,000
significant improvements in systolic

252
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:07,279
blood pressure, in diastolic blood

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:12,320
pressure, in BMI, in homocyine,

254
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:14,560
in hemoglobin A1C, in lipid profiles. So

255
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
again and again and again we're seeing

256
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
this improvement not just in the brain

257
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
but also in physiology. It's really

258
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,760
striking to see. Um Dr. Hathaway could

259
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,079
you mention one of the patients who came

260
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,320
through just an illustrative case um and

261
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,839
what you saw.

262
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,959
Yeah. Um, enthusiasm counts for a lot

263
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,760
and all my patients were enthusiastic

264
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,480
because we we look for that in in our

265
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,440
selection, but uh my patients who were

266
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:48,240
the most enthusiastic uh did the best.

267
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:52,320
Uh my patient who lost 35 lbs, she got

268
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,800
her ketones. Ketones was one of our uh

269
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,920
one of the things that we asked people

270
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,000
to do to get uh into ketosis,

271
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,360
meaning a ketone level between 1 and

272
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,160
four. This woman's ketones were 3.5 to

273
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,480
four within a month of starting the

274
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,120
protocol. She just she she just was um

275
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:18,160
well, like I said, I think she was

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,480
probably gifted in ketosis in some way.

277
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
Some people struggle with that. Some

278
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
people struggle with getting their

279
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,079
glucose down. For some people, it's it's

280
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,240
it's easy. Uh so each each individual

281
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,800
each individual is is their own

282
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,040
interesting challenge. But uh

283
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,640
uh this particular

284
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,040
woman who's an ApoE4, by the way, uh a

285
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:46,160
homozygous for a4, she um lost, like I

286
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,279
said, 35 pounds. She got rid of all of

287
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,880
her joint pain, muscle aches, etc. that

288
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,480
were keeping her from being able to

289
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,040
exercise. She was enthusiastic about all

290
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,000
aspects of exercise including the

291
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,480
highintensity interval

292
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,519
kind of exercise which is which is quite

293
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,880
quite demanding. Um after she lost she

294
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:12,800
quickly lost uh 20 pounds and then the

295
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,040
other 15 came off slowly. uh she and her

296
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
scores were just I I don't remember her

297
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,760
exact scores. I wish I could tell you

298
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,399
but her scores were were dramatically

299
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,880
improved within 3 months and of course

300
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,639
by 9 months they were they were really

301
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,279
excellent. Uh she she was able to during

302
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
the study which I did not encourage

303
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,279
during the study she decided she was

304
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,920
going to become a health coach and took

305
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
a health coaching course.

306
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,399
Yeah.

307
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,920
She she was just amazing. Yeah.

308
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,079
Yeah. you know, one of the earliest

309
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,480
patients I had uh wrote back and said,

310
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,120
you know, I have a new life now and um

311
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,800
she started her new nonprofit. She went

312
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,240
back to school. She just said, "Look,

313
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,680
this is my new life now. I'm going to do

314
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,600
all these things that I wasn't able to

315
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,279
do before." So, it's great to see. So

316
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,040
you mentioned the scores and I think you

317
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,800
know there's a huge amount of data which

318
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,720
is going to be one of the I think best

319
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,040
outcomes from this that we'll be able to

320
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,040
look at the epigenetics and and we'll be

321
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,800
able to look at the imaging and we'll be

322
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,279
able to look at all the different pieces

323
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,279
all the biochemistry etc all the and the

324
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,120
biomarkers of course these are all

325
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,000
critical but one of the points I wanted

326
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,800
to mention is that as you can imagine

327
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,360
when these people started their average

328
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,279
scores for their cognition were of

329
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,519
course below average. So if you're

330
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,880
looking at average for their age, most

331
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,880
of the people that are making up the

332
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,639
average don't have cognitive decline. So

333
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
of course they were below that. But

334
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,360
interestingly, at the conclusion, the

335
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,680
ones who were treated were actually

336
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,480
above the average, above the 50th

337
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,800
percentile for people their age. That's

338
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,600
50th percentile for people who are not

339
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,839
cognitively affected. just as Cat said a

340
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,160
few minutes ago, her patients ended up

341
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,560
being in the normal range for their

342
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
cognition, which again is unheard of

343
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,880
with these sorts of treatments. So that

344
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,320
was uh very very exciting to see. And of

345
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,639
course, the ones who were in the control

346
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,760
group started out below average and went

347
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,079
further downhill during that time. Um

348
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,760
that brings up another key point here,

349
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:12,399
which is the bounce. So the people who

350
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:16,480
were in the control group but then after

351
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,399
9 months they were offered six months of

352
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,440
free treatment so that they could get

353
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,160
the benefit and we have just one uh so

354
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,320
far just one site uh Dr. Craig Tanio

355
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,920
who's reported his what happened before

356
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,240
and you could see a beautiful they went

357
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,000
down then they went up strikingly but

358
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,199
Kat you made a really good point the

359
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,680
other day which is that even waiting

360
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,279
that nine months is not a good idea for

361
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,279
these people because it makes it

362
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,639
tougher. They're continuing that process

363
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,279
and maybe if you could say something

364
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,279
about your patients who were in group B

365
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,040
the control but then switched over at

366
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,600
the end of the nine months and began the

367
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,480
treatment. What happened to them?

368
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,959
Yeah. So my personal feeling is for

369
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,040
starters we have showed you tremendous

370
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,680
benefit in all measures of cognition

371
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,560
with this study and so we know this

372
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,519
works and I feel like the need to have a

373
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,720
control group in the future should be

374
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
done away with because I watched my

375
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,440
patients decline that were not getting

376
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,120
active treatment and then once they

377
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,760
rolled over into the active treatment

378
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,240
they did not improve as quickly.

379
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,040
as my patients that I had gotten earlier

380
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,800
in the process. So, I feel like, you

381
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,720
know, the longer you wait while your

382
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,560
brain is degenerating, the harder it's

383
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,360
going to be to turn that ship around,

384
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,480
you know. So, so they did improve.

385
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,040
Absolutely. But, um, it wasn't as

386
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
rapidly as the patients did in the other

387
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,199
treatment group. It's a really good

388
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,399
point and it really brings up the issue

389
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,480
of ethics in standard control groups in

390
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,959
in standard of care treatment control

391
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,600
groups. And so I wonder whether there

392
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,079
will end up being more use of historical

393
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,360
controls because the historical controls

394
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,759
you could see that you know they clearly

395
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,759
went downhill. there's less of that as

396
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
people are catching on and people are

397
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,440
trying to do some of the things

398
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,360
themselves and so the control groups

399
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
tend to do a little bit better even

400
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,279
though we saw that there was some

401
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,199
decline overall they tend to do a little

402
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,399
bit better than control groups from say

403
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:22,240
20 30 years ago so people are kind of

404
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,959
catching on to this uh and what in your

405
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,199
I know you're you're an expert in BHRT

406
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,480
uh in bio identical hormone replacement

407
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,720
how many of your patients ended up being

408
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,160
treated that included bio identical

409
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,519
hormones.

410
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,320
Well, every woman who was in my study

411
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,920
was treated with BHIP

412
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:48,240
and of course, you know, I I certainly

413
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:52,000
have spoken at great length in many uh

414
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:55,199
in many different venues about the uh

415
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,759
incredible power of uh estradile for

416
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,959
brain health uh for cardiovascular

417
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,519
health and for bone health. Uh and

418
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:06,799
fortunately at this particular point in

419
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,199
time uh menopausal hormone replacement

420
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,760
is having a moment. Uh there's a lot

421
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,679
more positive being written about it.

422
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,600
They've talked about it. There's

423
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:20,959
multiple books. you know the physicians,

424
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,720
the women physicians who are uh you know

425
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,839
the the number of women physicians has

426
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,799
expanded tremendously and that group of

427
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,000
women that that wave of women physicians

428
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,640
is reaching their mid-40s now and they

429
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
are all like we are not going to be

430
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,120
putting up with no hormone replacement.

431
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
We are going to be getting our our

432
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,840
hormones and it's very important. I

433
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,480
mean, there's so much that I could talk

434
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,520
about that for two hours, but the the

435
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,559
importance of using the right hormone,

436
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:55,520
topical estradiol that's biioidentical

437
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,080
and real progesterone is extremely

438
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,559
important and also replacing

439
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:03,280
testosterone at a low dose for women is

440
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,760
also important. All of those things make

441
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,039
a huge difference uh in terms of overall

442
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,640
health and in terms of cognitive health.

443
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah. And of course, the issue often

444
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,799
comes up about age. In this trial,

445
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,400
people were from 45 to 76. I can't

446
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,039
remember if the highest one was 76 or

447
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,840
77, but it was one of those two. Uh and

448
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,400
and the average age in this trial was

449
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,880
65. So, it was actually fairly similar.

450
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,880
Now, we've all seen younger people. When

451
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,160
I was training way back in the 1980s at

452
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,720
UCSF, we never saw people in their 40s

453
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,760
and 50s with Alzheimer's disease. It's a

454
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,799
relatively common thing to see now. Uh

455
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,720
so things have changed along the way. Um

456
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,480
but in this particular case, the average

457
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,160
age was 65. There were 50 patients who

458
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
were in the treated group and there were

459
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,240
23 who were in the control group. It was

460
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,000
originally meant to be 2:1. We got a

461
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
couple of extras in the treatment. One

462
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,640
we had a dropout uh in the other group.

463
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,480
So uh some people would say, well, why

464
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,679
wasn't it a thousand people? So here's

465
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,400
why.

466
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,280
When you have something that has a tiny

467
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,280
tiny effect, you have to have a thousand

468
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,600
or more patients because you won't have

469
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,559
a statistically significant difference.

470
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,160
So we started by calculating what is it

471
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,679
going to take to see a statistically

472
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,640
significant difference and the answer

473
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,480
was between 50 and 60 people. So we

474
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,000
ended up with 73. We wanted to go a

475
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,240
little bit beyond that to make sure that

476
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,280
we had that. The other factor here is

477
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,840
this trial cost $6.6 6 million and we

478
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,600
are truly grateful to Diana Mariam and

479
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,559
the four winds foundation for the

480
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:41,280
support of the trial. Other trials if

481
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:45,120
you do a thousand people that will be an

482
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,760
$80 million trial. There is actually one

483
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:51,600
uh one treatment where now the trial

484
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:54,880
costs have exceeded a billion.

485
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,799
Hard to believe but there it does cost a

486
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,400
lot of money to do these trials as you

487
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,720
can imagine. And we, you know, you're

488
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,280
generating large amount of data. You've

489
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,280
got a lot of people involved. Uh, as we

490
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,039
were going through this preprint,

491
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,840
looking at all the acknowledgements and

492
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,559
all the co-authors, you know, I realized

493
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,720
how what a huge effort this this really

494
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,400
does take a village. It really is a huge

495
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,600
huge effort for years and thousands of

496
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:25,360
hours on a lot of people's parts. So,

497
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,360
yes, great to do one for a,000. Um, you

498
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,360
know, if we come up with $80 million to

499
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,600
do that, that would be a consideration.

500
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,240
But the key here, and this is why the

501
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,400
statistics are so important, is to do

502
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,159
enough people to see if there's a

503
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,159
statistically significant difference.

504
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
And the answer is it's a huge

505
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,720
difference. And in fact, the statistics

506
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,960
were not at the 0.05 level, which is the

507
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,799
standard accepted. Most of these

508
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:54,320
differences were less than 0.0001.

509
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,799
So a very high degree of significance

510
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,440
for most of these uh trials. The

511
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,840
processing speed was 0.01. So one out of

512
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
a 100. So really striking striking

513
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,240
differences.

514
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,679
And Dale, excuse me. I think it's

515
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,520
important to note that this is

516
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,000
replicating our previous proof of

517
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,159
concept, right? So this isn't a flash in

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
the pan. This is replicating the results

519
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,200
that we had in the first trial. And

520
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
we've done even better in the responses

521
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
in this trial than we did in the first

522
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,880
trial, which already was exciting news

523
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
that 84% of our patients got better. So

524
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,280
now we're seeing even in some of the

525
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,559
sites like mine, 100% of people had

526
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,320
improvements. So um I think that's an

527
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,400
important thing to note.

528
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
Yeah, that's a great point. Uh so now

529
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,559
you know the the evidence if you take

530
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,440
all the evidence together there's a lot

531
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,120
of anecdotal evidence multiple published

532
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
um hundreds and hundreds of patients

533
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,440
people are seeing this time and time

534
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,120
again um then we have the trial that you

535
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,120
mentioned the proof of concept trial

536
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,520
where people the majority of people

537
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
improve then there was a replication of

538
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,600
that independently by Dr. Heather

539
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,320
Sanderson and her group that saw

540
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:05,039
virtually identical results and now we

541
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,960
have a randomized controlled trial. So,

542
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,000
you know, anyone can say I don't believe

543
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,440
it. Um, but in fact, it's it is

544
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
sometimes hard to believe because it's

545
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,919
so much better outcomes than have been

546
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
seen in the past. But it fits very much

547
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,600
with what people are seeing every day.

548
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,840
And we're now seeing also what it takes

549
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,799
to get that. So let's talk about that

550
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,919
for a moment because we see that the low

551
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,000
compliance just as Dean Orish has had

552
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,440
noted years ago with his cardiovascular

553
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
work. Less compliance, less outcome, no

554
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,720
big surprise. Better compliance, better

555
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,159
outcome. But Ann, you mentioned a few

556
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,600
years ago, you know, the compliance is

557
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
not easy. You're you're doing something,

558
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,799
but yet you've been able to put together

559
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,559
a really fantastic team. So an what do

560
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,320
you say to people to get the good

561
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:55,600
compliance that you and your team get?

562
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,679
Well, you have to work with these each

563
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,440
individual. By the way, I I do want to

564
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,960
mention that I did not do this alone

565
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,960
with my group. I had a phenomenal uh

566
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:11,039
nutritionist, Kia Sanford, a phenomenal

567
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:14,720
health coach, Lynn K Phillips, and uh my

568
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:19,600
Stacy Hawkins, my uh site coordinator,

569
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:22,799
just phenomenal at their jobs. And so we

570
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:25,679
uh worked with these people uh in the

571
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:28,640
study who were already, you know, chosen

572
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:32,720
because they were on board. they really

573
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,799
wanted to to do it. Um, but we had very

574
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:37,919
close communication

575
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,919
between all of us as a team. When

576
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,480
someone picked up, okay, some someone's

577
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:46,400
fallen off here or there, we were on

578
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,360
them immediately to help them correct

579
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,120
course and get back into whatever

580
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,760
whatever was the problem. you know,

581
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:57,120
someone, you know, people developed um

582
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,679
people fell and they had to see a a

583
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,000
physical therapist uh and a massage

584
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,320
therapist. And so, we would facilitate

585
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:09,200
things like that to make sure that um we

586
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:14,799
kept them as active as possible, as on

587
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,679
track as possible with we we tracked so

588
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:20,320
many things uh as a group. We tracked

589
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:23,279
how much sleep they got, how much deep

590
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,240
sleep, how much REM sleep, uh heart rate

591
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:30,640
overnight, uh oxygen level overnight,

592
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,720
etc. Um just as just as one example, you

593
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,559
know, we we tracked their their diet

594
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,919
very

595
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,039
Kia tracked their diet extremely closely

596
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,600
knowing, you know, why they were missing

597
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,000
ketosis that day because they had all

598
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,600
their they had their entire diet written

599
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,080
down.

600
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,240
our exercise code

601
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,880
right we used chronometer

602
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,919
that our nutritionists were able to

603
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,679
literally get the information online we

604
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,440
used a lot of different wearables and

605
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,799
trackers in the study

606
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,480
yeah or ring was very helpful

607
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,400
um and heart math was very helpful for

608
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,840
stress reduction

609
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,240
um heart math has been was helpful in

610
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,600
our first study helpful in this study

611
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,919
we're we're very grateful grateful to

612
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:26,400
them. Um and um

613
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:29,679
ketosis was measured by a ketone a blood

614
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,919
ketone meter on a regular basis. So

615
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,159
there were a lot there was a lot of work

616
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,679
and a lot of coordination between all

617
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:40,960
the people on each of our teams to get

618
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,120
this to get this to work. And uh some

619
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,600
might say, well, wasn't that extremely

620
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:48,640
expensive? And you know, our our answer

621
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:52,400
is uh well, yes, it's it's it's

622
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,520
expensive, but uh what's the cost of uh

623
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:58,559
memory care, assisted living uh for a

624
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,440
year once someone has dementia?

625
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:04,240
uh it's a lot more than uh the cost of

626
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,240
treating a patient in the early stages

627
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,080
of uh mild cognitive impairment, early

628
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,400
dementia

629
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,679
compared to five years in uh you know

630
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,000
memory care.

631
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,480
Absolutely.

632
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,720
Well, the thing with the coaching is you

633
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,039
need the coaching to help get started

634
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,400
and and get this program assimilated

635
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,720
into your life, but you don't need it

636
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,240
forever. That's not a forever cost. But

637
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,279
we definitely learned from the first

638
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:34,159
study that having the coaching and the

639
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:39,039
support, nutrition support, exercise

640
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:40,799
support, um diet, um uh just to help

641
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,279
with integrating all the aspects of the

642
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,640
protocol that helps people to shift very

643
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:49,440
quickly. So um like in the first study,

644
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,840
this study, every patient was assigned a

645
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,320
nutritionist, a health coach, and an

646
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:57,840
exercise coach. The exercise coaches

647
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,480
were amazing and and I had people that

648
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,880
never exercised a day in their life turn

649
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,679
into regular exercisers because we did

650
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,159
require that they exercise six days a

651
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,600
week in this protocol and we tracked it.

652
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,679
So um you know patients had to be

653
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,279
motivated to be in the study because

654
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,600
they had to have a certain level of

655
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,880
compliance with every aspect of the of

656
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
the protocol and if they were

657
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,520
non-compliant we had to discharge them

658
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,480
from the study. So that did help the

659
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,039
motivation for people. But I I hope that

660
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,360
that everybody else will be motivated by

661
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,159
the results that we got to institute

662
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,200
their own programs if they're having

663
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,559
problems because uh it just made a huge

664
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,559
difference.

665
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah. I mean this really has told us we

666
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,960
have to change

667
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,039
to recognize that you know this

668
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
something can be done. This is now

669
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,679
really the first effective approach to

670
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
cognitive decline. Please don't wait.

671
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,279
you know, people should get evaluated,

672
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,039
get on active prevention or early

673
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,200
treatment because there's so much that

674
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,120
can be done. And Kat, if you could say

675
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,960
something, I know in the first trial you

676
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,799
had a support group and it's been

677
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,279
pointed out that support groups tend to

678
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,039
help with getting even better outcomes.

679
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,360
So, we can continue now to see what are

680
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,360
the things that you add on to get better

681
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,640
and better outcomes. If you could talk

682
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,600
about a little bit about your support

683
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,000
group.

684
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,480
Yeah, right. We in the current trial we

685
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,120
had a support group and um my health

686
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,840
coach and nutritionist facilitated the

687
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,279
support group. They met monthly. Um this

688
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,440
was for the patients in the active

689
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,679
treatment of course and then once the

690
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,000
patients that were in the delayed

691
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
treatment um crossed over into active

692
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,159
treatment, they were able to join the

693
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,200
group as well. People found that

694
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:43,279
immensely supportive. um people that

695
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,960
were further along in the program were

696
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,200
able to help people that were just

697
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
coming to it to let them know that oh

698
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,320
maybe they struggled with ketosis or

699
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:55,039
exercise or brain training. But um

700
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,159
definitely that support of the patients

701
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,760
I think probably was a factor of why my

702
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,720
patients did well. Um so they really

703
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,159
enjoyed that and we've just um secured

704
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,159
funding that we're going to be able to

705
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,320
continue that support group for our

706
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,159
patients to stay the course. Right. So

707
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,120
um so we'll probably be starting that

708
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,039
next month. But both the patients and

709
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,200
their study partner who was usually the

710
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,679
spouse. So patients had to have a study

711
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,039
partner to come into this trial for two

712
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,720
reasons. One we validated that they had

713
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,279
impairments in all these different

714
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,159
areas. And so the study partner had to

715
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:37,279
also with the rating scale, you know, um

716
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,200
show us that that this patient was truly

717
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,039
um struggling in certain areas of their

718
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,440
life and their memory. Um so um so the

719
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,039
study partners were needed for the

720
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,360
rating scales, but they were needed to

721
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,080
support their loved one to help

722
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,840
implement this program daytoday as well.

723
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,159
So both the patients and their study

724
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:58,159
partners came to the support group.

725
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,720
Great. And an could you speak to the

726
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,720
issue that comes up often which is okay

727
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,960
this is great for the few people that

728
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,480
that will you will want to do this but

729
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,080
if you have you know a hundred people

730
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,799
who come to you on a you know just a

731
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,120
day-to-day basis what percentage your

732
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,039
just your guess what percentage are

733
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,600
appropriate for getting into your

734
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,200
protocol versus those that just say you

735
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,440
know I I'm just not going to be able to

736
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,200
do this.

737
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,039
Um well the ones who end up talking to

738
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,480
me in general are those who are

739
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,960
interested. So yes I have you know uh

740
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,360
for people who come in who make who who

741
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,279
take the time to think about it make an

742
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,880
appointment come in to get help with

743
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:43,200
their diminishing cognition

744
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,080
I would say 95%

745
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,480
decide to uh at least go ahead and try

746
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,520
the protocol and I would say 90%

747
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,360
continue.

748
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
Yeah. Fantastic. because of course we

749
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,440
want to make this available to everyone

750
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,600
possible and as you indicated look it's

751
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,000
far less in terms of cost than going to

752
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,480
a memory care facility and it's far less

753
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,880
in cost actually than other therapeutic

754
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,039
options um that are that are out there.

755
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,960
So in fact there there are some real

756
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,799
advantage and of course it's also more

757
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,279
effective and fewer side effects and

758
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:17,279
improving your overall health. So, it

759
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,039
it's kind of a no-brainer that it's

760
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,080
actually the the best thing going here

761
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,679
for for many reasons. Uh we've got uh

762
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,200
we've got some excellent questions here.

763
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,480
So, let's let's start to go through some

764
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,480
of these questions because there are so

765
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,919
many good ones. Uh first one here is

766
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,840
what's the best way to get started.

767
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,120
There are a couple of ways. Uh one thing

768
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,440
is just to go on my cqest.com.

769
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,279
It's a free cognitive test and you can

770
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,640
go from there because it does sneak up

771
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,480
on you. There are a lot of people that

772
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,760
think, well, I'm here. I'm really not

773
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,039
having problems. and they'll find out

774
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,559
no, they really are. The other

775
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:49,279
possibility, take a look at the

776
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,159
preprint. You'll see the six sites where

777
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,559
this was done and contact one of the

778
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,600
physicians like Dr. Hathaway or Dr. Tops

779
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,840
or Dr. Tanio or Dr. Bergman or one of

780
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,360
those people um and talk to them about

781
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,720
uh you know whe what they're doing at

782
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,080
the time, whether they're taking new

783
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,000
patients etc. Um John here says what

784
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,159
were the size of the group? So 50 in the

785
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,720
treatment group, 23 in the control

786
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,880
group. Next one here is uh Buck

787
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,000
Institute had a trial about achieving

788
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,799
ketosis. Uh yeah and and uh the the

789
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,799
conceptual nature the looking at the

790
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,880
inflammatory piece and the looking at

791
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:29,760
the toxicity and looking at energetics

792
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,919
mitochondrial support what molecules

793
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,720
interact with a itself a remarkable look

794
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,039
it's essentially

795
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,000
that's amaloid precursor protein not

796
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,240
everybody thank you I was gonna say that

797
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,240
amaloid precursor protein is a is a

798
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,399
receptor that sits in your neurons

799
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,480
especially near synapses And it

800
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,240
literally is a switch that's looking are

801
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,039
you going toward connection? Are you

802
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,360
going toward protection? So when when

803
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,120
things are bad, you go toward protection

804
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,600
and makes the amaloid which is an

805
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,399
antimicrobial which kills herpes and

806
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:04,960
kills various fungi and kills various

807
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,600
bacteria. When things are good, you're

808
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,640
making something called SAP alpha,

809
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,480
soluble AP alpha. That's building new

810
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,960
synapses. That's connection. So you got

811
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,720
connection protection. all these people

812
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,799
that we're seeing are on the protection

813
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,240
side. We got to get them back over. We

814
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,559
got to get rid of the things that are

815
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,880
causing that. So, the Buck Institute is

816
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,279
where the a lot of the conceptual nature

817
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,679
of this came from. And of course, Dr.

818
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,679
Hathaway uh and and Dr. Tubes are

819
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,159
experts in functional medicine, which is

820
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,240
the translational piece of this. How do

821
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,760
you actually tell what's going on and

822
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,440
and what to address? I think that's

823
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,799
where we're headed. Now, as far as this

824
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,360
particular trial you mentioned, which is

825
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:45,679
for ketones only, you know, in general,

826
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,480
we haven't found that single items are

827
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,640
that beneficial as much as an overall

828
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,080
precision medicine protocol. However,

829
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,399
I'm interested in the results of the

830
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,960
trial. We'll see. Um, it's important to

831
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:59,840
point out though that whether or not any

832
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,640
specific thing helped, it still may be

833
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,320
part of an overall optimal protocol.

834
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,360
That's that's the change in thinking

835
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,560
that we all have to undergo. Dale, can I

836
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,240
say something about in our trial? So,

837
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,320
um, the requirement in our trial was

838
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,200
that people achieve ketone levels of one

839
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,599
to four, so kind of mild to moderate

840
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,679
ketosis. And Dr. Hathaway mentioned her

841
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,240
patient that went almost up to four very

842
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,079
quickly. Most people don't do that. Um,

843
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,480
but what we observed in the first trial

844
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,720
was sometimes when people did go deeper

845
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,760
into ketosis, they had additional

846
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,000
benefits. Some people's brains light up

847
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,919
with ketosis and other people don't

848
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
notice as much. So, it's not a

849
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,320
one-sizefits-all necessarily for

850
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,879
everyone, but for the purposes of a

851
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,280
study, we had to standardize what what

852
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,599
people were doing with the diet. And I

853
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,760
have to say uniformly, I did exit

854
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,359
interviews with a lot of my patients and

855
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,800
they would all say they had so much more

856
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,720
energy. Their energy was um steady

857
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,320
throughout the day. they didn't crave

858
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,880
sugar, you know, so people all, you

859
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,480
know, it's a shift for some people to

860
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,040
really shift into ketosis if they're

861
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,520
eating a lot of carbs in their diet, but

862
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,839
but uniformly people appreciated the

863
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,200
benefits of the ketosis.

864
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,520
It's a great point. And as a

865
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,680
neurologist, you know, we would look for

866
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,760
to say that someone had Alzheimer's, we

867
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,920
would look for a PET scan that showed

868
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,720
reduced glucose utilization in the

869
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,680
temporal and parietal loes. And so yes,

870
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,440
you are in you are improving that by

871
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,800
getting those ketones because now not

872
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,960
only do they have the glucose which

873
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,480
they're not utilizing well enough, but

874
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,480
they've also they're getting better

875
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,000
insulin sensitivity. So now the glucose

876
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,320
is working better. Now they're getting

877
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,320
the ketones as well. So they're becoming

878
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,680
metabolically flexible. It's like a

879
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,680
Prius that's run out of both fuels and

880
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,760
now you got both fuels working again,

881
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,599
which is why you see these tremendous

882
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
improvements. So yeah, absolutely.

883
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,599
tremendous weight loss in some of our

884
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,079
patients that needed to lose weight. And

885
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:04,160
of course, we found ways to support the

886
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,680
people that were already thin and didn't

887
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,400
need to lose weight, you know, with

888
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,560
additional protein and collagen and, you

889
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,160
know, things like that. But, um, but the

890
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,320
tremendous weight loss for some of our

891
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,839
patient and you mentioned 35 pounds, the

892
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,160
gentleman that I spoke of that needed

893
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,800
the three joint replacements lost 35

894
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,119
pounds as well, which helped.

895
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,520
Interestingly, we had uh diagnosed his

896
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:27,520
sleep apnoa and then the sleep apnnea

897
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,040
got much better of course once he lost

898
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,040
the 35 pounds. So um so yeah the ketosis

899
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,040
part has has been an interesting thing

900
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,640
for both of our protocols.

901
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,240
But you brought up a really good point

902
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,079
which is there is a difference between

903
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
the person who comes in and wants to

904
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,960
lose some weight and is does have some

905
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,880
some extra atapost to lose versus the

906
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,280
ones who are frail. there are people who

907
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,720
are frail uh and so there is a

908
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,640
difference there in the way you treat

909
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,280
them to get the best outcomes. I would

910
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:56,560
also mention the the APOE4 group is

911
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,400
interested to say well wait a minute

912
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
about half of the people that we had in

913
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,640
this trial were APOE4 positive. There

914
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,280
were six that were APOE4 homozygous. Um

915
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,920
and then the rest of the half was uh was

916
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,599
hetererozygous. Um and you the question

917
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,599
was well did they do better or worse

918
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,079
than the other? In our earlier trial we

919
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:17,760
we did look at that and it turns out

920
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,079
that they both had statistically

921
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,079
significant improvements. Um so we and

922
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,680
we do see on a daily basis people who

923
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:27,599
are ApoE4 uh do very well on this

924
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,000
protocol as well as other but we'll see

925
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,400
we those are data we have not crunched

926
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,480
yet so there is tons of stuff still to

927
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,800
look at I'm interested particularly in

928
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,720
the correlations the people who got

929
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,560
metabolic improvements are they the ones

930
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,680
that got the best cognitive improvements

931
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,000
or not we have looked at the biioarkers

932
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:52,000
and so we looked at a beta 42 to40 ratio

933
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,760
GFAP P NFL and PTA 217

934
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,560
and let's say the A beta that he's

935
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,320
talking about that's the amaloid levels.

936
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,800
Great point. Yeah. So that's the amaloid

937
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,440
ratios. So what was interesting was the

938
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,079
GFAP which is the one that that that

939
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,640
reflects the ongoing inflammation in the

940
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,000
brain.

941
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,920
Wait and say that's gal fibrillary

942
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,359
acidic protein because these are

943
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,839
concepts for a lot of people.

944
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:17,839
Yeah, great great point. So yes, gal. So

945
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:20,160
what this is actually it's a protein

946
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,560
that is in your aststerytes not the

947
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,280
neurons and what happens is as your

948
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,040
astroytes are responding they're

949
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,680
responding with inflammation and they're

950
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,079
responding with attempted repair they

951
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,839
will actually get bigger and there so

952
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,480
they make this protein which is an

953
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,400
intermediate filament protein in the

954
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,720
astroite. you see as the aststerite

955
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,720
balloons up and is now getting it's

956
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,480
telling you you got active aststerytes

957
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,880
in your brain because of inflammation

958
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,359
and attempted repair. So the good news

959
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,440
is it was statistically significantly

960
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,560
improved in the treatment group and not

961
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:56,400
in the other group. But with PAL what we

962
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,160
found was something interesting and now

963
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,079
others are seeing the same thing but

964
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,200
initially we were not aware of this.

965
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,880
When you lose weight your pal goes up

966
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,960
without any change in your brain. you

967
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,079
just see a pa when your when your weight

968
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,160
goes up your pa is low. So you can

969
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,520
imagine there were people where they

970
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,680
would lose a lot of weight. They would

971
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,680
do much better cognitively but their pal

972
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,400
would actually shoot up as if they were

973
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,960
having more problem. Now over the nine

974
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,119
months they start to come down again.

975
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,359
And so it did turn out that there was

976
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,160
just barely significant an improvement

977
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,160
in pa but it wasn't impressive. And I

978
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,960
think that's partly because a lot of

979
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,960
people in group A lost weight whereas we

980
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,800
know that people in group B did not. In

981
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,760
fact, they gained a little bit of weight

982
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,680
um on the group B side. So I think that

983
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,960
there's a bit of a compromise there in

984
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,720
the PAL.

985
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,400
Well, we might need to analyze that

986
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,400
separately. It just occurred to me that

987
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,880
we should look at the people who didn't

988
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,560
gain weight, I mean didn't lose weight

989
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,560
versus the people that lost weight and

990
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,720
then see if we see a different signal

991
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:01,040
there. I think one other interesting

992
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,599
thing Dale was about the amaloid that um

993
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,000
you know we found that all but two of

994
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,240
the patients were positive with the

995
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,760
levels of amaloid which was pretty

996
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,720
interesting.

997
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,520
The vast majority of these people had

998
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,520
had the am the the amaloid related

999
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,880
Alzheimer process occurring in their

1000
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,119
brain. Now that doesn't say that they

1001
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,280
didn't have some louisi bodies there. uh

1002
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,440
about 60% of people who end up with

1003
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,680
Alzheimer's at autopsy will have some

1004
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,200
louisi bodies as well. So there can be

1005
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,440
multiple processes as we're

1006
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,359
understanding these much more from the

1007
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,359
physiological side instead of the

1008
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,520
pathological side. Oh, you know there's

1009
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,800
some bad stuff get rid of it. No, why is

1010
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,480
it there? As we're understanding that we

1011
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,160
we now are beginning to understand that

1012
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,000
there are certain pathogens that are

1013
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,280
targeted by amalloid and certain

1014
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,119
pathogens that are targeted by

1015
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,520
alphasuclean. So for example,

1016
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,320
alphasuclean tends to be good at killing

1017
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,240
E.coli. It tends to be good at killing

1018
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:00,640
staff orius. Uh amalloid beta tends to

1019
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,720
be good at killing herpes simplex. So

1020
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,720
this is beginning to tell us what's

1021
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,720
going on in the brain. And it's not so

1022
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,480
surprising that in fact that you'll

1023
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,640
often have these multiple things. You

1024
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,720
have the PTA, you have the amaloid, you

1025
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,839
have the alphasuclean, and you also have

1026
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,359
the TDP43 which is another response like

1027
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,480
amaloid. And TDP43 tends to be something

1028
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:24,560
that responds to viruses that get into

1029
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,800
your cells. So we're now beginning to

1030
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,359
understand this whole process more from

1031
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,960
the physiological response side than

1032
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,680
from this old idea of there's something

1033
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,000
bad, get rid of it.

1034
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,760
Segue the test. I mean, this was

1035
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,640
important because because what you're

1036
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,560
hearing is we have these markers that

1037
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,400
are, you know, of things accumulating in

1038
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,720
the brain with Alzheimer's and

1039
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,480
neurodeenerative processes. But the

1040
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:51,920
thinking now is that they are

1041
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,319
antimicrobial. So they they can they can

1042
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,319
happen in response to toxins but also

1043
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,440
infections. So one of the things that we

1044
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,079
did in this study is we tested a whole

1045
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,599
battery of infections. And these become

1046
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,119
our treatment targets when they're

1047
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,800
positive is to to help um to work to

1048
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,760
reduce the burden of all these

1049
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,160
infections in people. And for those

1050
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,079
people who know that um HSV1 herpes

1051
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,119
simplex virus type one is associated

1052
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,040
with an increased risk of Alzheimer's

1053
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,200
disease. Uh it makes sense that bec if

1054
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,480
you have untreated

1055
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,319
uh high HSV1 in your body and in your

1056
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,040
brain your body's then going to make

1057
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,560
more amaloid which then is going to go

1058
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,440
ahead and start do more destruction in

1059
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,960
your brain. So that's we treated many

1060
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,319
viruses but especially we look for HSV1

1061
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,560
and and treat that.

1062
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,160
And of course now we just found out in

1063
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,040
the last year right that there's a huge

1064
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,760
correlation with multiple sclerosis with

1065
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:57,760
other immune disorders because of the of

1066
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,599
the viruses but it's always been part of

1067
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,839
our paradigm with the treatments that we

1068
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,319
do. Tests for these infections support

1069
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,800
the immune system because when you have

1070
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,880
viruses they activate the immune system

1071
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,839
and then immune problems release all

1072
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,000
kinds of inflammatory chemicals that can

1073
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,160
you know further the neurodeeneration.

1074
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,520
So I think one question Dale that I can

1075
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:19,359
imagine people are saying well what do

1076
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,920
we do about the herpes since that is

1077
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,599
such a big big thing and I would say

1078
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,839
most of us treated our patients with um

1079
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,480
with valicyclo

1080
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,520
which is a wellknown antiviral approved

1081
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,079
for long-term use with herpes. So we did

1082
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,560
um treat with that and then follow their

1083
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,359
um antibbody their tighter levels of the

1084
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,079
herpes and um you know we still don't

1085
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:46,720
really know how long you need to treat

1086
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,280
that that uh that's still being learned

1087
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:51,280
about but um that is something we did I

1088
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,599
think pretty much all the investigators

1089
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,760
used bell cycle there for herpes

1090
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,400
and this comes right back to the idea of

1091
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,480
a comprehensive protocol as you know a

1092
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,000
paper just recently appeared showing

1093
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,599
that if you just treat you just take

1094
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,280
people with Alzheimer's and you just

1095
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,520
treat them with valet cyclloe. The hope

1096
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,560
was oh it's going to go away. No, they

1097
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,599
actually did worse than control if you

1098
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,440
just used that alone. And I suspect

1099
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,280
that's because now you're getting in and

1100
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,760
you're creating more inflammation as

1101
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,119
they're trying to mop this stuff up. So,

1102
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,480
you know what? You've got to do the

1103
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,040
whole thing. You've got to use it all

1104
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,040
together as a precision medicine or

1105
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,800
functional medicine or systems medicine

1106
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,839
approach. We've got a lot of good

1107
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,200
questions here and I know we're running

1108
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,200
out of time. So, let's go through some

1109
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,640
more of these questions. So, one was

1110
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,280
when testing for lime, the

1111
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,079
pre-publication said you used what

1112
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:44,720
specific panel or tests did you test

1113
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:50,880
for?

1114
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:53,119
Um we uh tested the uh lime immunolot

1115
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,319
for both borellia which is a classic

1116
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:59,119
lime as well as burellia miamotoy which

1117
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,119
is um relapsing tick fever that is

1118
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:03,200
common in some of our areas like here in

1119
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,000
California. So we tested amino for

1120
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,480
those. We tested the fish test um

1121
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,520
fluorescent immunino hybridization

1122
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,640
something or other forum besia and

1123
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,920
bartinella and um those were the main

1124
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,480
panels that we did with ienics. The rest

1125
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,359
of the co- infections like anoplasma or

1126
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,240
lichia we used or labcore testing that's

1127
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,480
at quest and labcore. Um and then all

1128
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:31,520
the viruses that we tested were also

1129
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,000
through lab core. We tested herpes, we

1130
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,040
tested cytogalo virus, myopplasma,

1131
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,920
toxoplasmos, toxoplasma.

1132
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,599
Um I'm probably

1133
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,119
HSV6

1134
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,480
HHV6.

1135
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,680
Yes. Um so

1136
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,680
anoplasma Ioplasma.

1137
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:50,319
Yeah. So yeah, so a lot of these tests

1138
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:53,040
we were able to get through commercially

1139
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,599
available, you know, lab companies that

1140
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:57,599
and and I'll just say one trick for

1141
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:00,000
clinicians that are listening. Um

1142
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,520
because I I can get, you know, most of

1143
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,839
this stuff covered to people's

1144
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,400
insurance, but I always put 10 diagnosis

1145
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,680
codes. So I try to tell the story of why

1146
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,760
I need all these tests and uh and they

1147
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,599
generally can can get covered in the

1148
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,400
workup for people.

1149
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,800
Yeah. Igenics uh accepts Medicare.

1150
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,640
They accept Medicare and they added one

1151
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,400
commercial insurer. I mean it's a

1152
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,920
barrier with hygienics because it's

1153
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,000
expensive

1154
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,920
and so you know it is difficult for

1155
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,760
people to get the proper testing there.

1156
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,720
But yes for Medicare again with the

1157
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,200
proper diagnosis codes you can get

1158
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,720
testing covered on Medicare but as as

1159
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,359
you know we heard we're seeing people

1160
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,040
earlier and earlier with with cognitive

1161
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,160
decline and so they don't all have

1162
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,160
Medicare.

1163
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,440
Yeah. There's a question here from an

1164
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,359
about NeuroQ. Um, and full disclosure, I

1165
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
was involved in creating it. So, please

1166
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,880
understand that. All I can say, it's got

1167
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,079
six different components in it. It

1168
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,440
addresses some of the things we've

1169
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,200
talked about, but supplements are

1170
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,040
supplementary. I think that's the most

1171
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,040
important point to realize. All

1172
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,640
supplements are supplementary. You've

1173
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:04,880
got to get at the fundamentals. The

1174
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,119
great news is we now have we now have a

1175
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,280
foundation. So, we can now begin to add

1176
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,599
what happens if you add stem cells. What

1177
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
happens if you add intraasal peptides?

1178
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,119
What happens if you add these things?

1179
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:18,160
We've got a foundation that we know and

1180
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:19,920
we've proved works. Uh question here

1181
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:22,480
about Louisibody disease. This is a

1182
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,800
great question. Louibody disease is a

1183
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,440
close cousin of both Alzheimer's and

1184
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,760
Parkinson's. You have the alpha suclean

1185
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,680
that you make in Parkinson's, but you

1186
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,839
have the cognitive change that is very

1187
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:35,680
similar to Alzheimer's with some some

1188
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,319
differences often with some visual

1189
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,400
hallucinations and things like that. So

1190
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,240
when and we do see people on this

1191
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,480
protocol do well with Louisibody

1192
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:46,560
disease, but you really have to focus in

1193
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,960
on the toxic part. Cat was just talking

1194
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,880
about toxins and how important it is to

1195
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,280
look for these. They kind of three

1196
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,359
different types. The inorganics, uh,

1197
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,920
things like air pollution and mercury,

1198
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,640
the organics, things like tuine and

1199
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,200
benzene and and microlastics and

1200
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,319
anesthetic agents. And then it's the

1201
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,079
biotoxins, the things like triccoins and

1202
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,480
okrtoxin A and things like that. And by

1203
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,119
the way,

1204
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,240
translate he's talking about mold.

1205
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:17,760
Yeah, mold related toxins. And this

1206
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:20,000
OTAA, the okra toxin A is actually one

1207
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,400
that specifically damages the

1208
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:25,599
hippocample neurons. So that's a

1209
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,760
particularly important one. Uh so yeah,

1210
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,760
so that that's the situation. Please, if

1211
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:32,160
you're dealing with Louis body disease,

1212
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,640
make sure to see someone who is really

1213
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,680
good with dealing with toxins like Dr.

1214
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,720
Hathaway or Dr. Tubes. Let's say what we

1215
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:44,960
we did as far as the testing for toxins.

1216
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:47,839
So, we did um panels um with real-time

1217
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,400
labs for chemical toxins and we also did

1218
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,200
a panel with them for micotoxins. In our

1219
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:55,359
first study, we used what's now Mosaic

1220
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,359
Labs. It was Great Plain Labs. Um, so

1221
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:59,839
they also do testing for both of these.

1222
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,520
And they did not have both panels

1223
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,599
available at the time we started the

1224
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,160
study. But both of those companies will

1225
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,400
do panels for both micotoxins and

1226
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,880
chemical toxins. And then we tested

1227
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,040
heavy metals through LabCore. So Quest

1228
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,160
and Labcore. And you can get blood

1229
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,240
levels of, you know, mercury and cadmium

1230
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,319
and lead and arsenic, which is what we

1231
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,160
did. And I would just say a caveat again

1232
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:25,680
to the clinicians. If you're testing for

1233
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:28,240
mercury, I I know I use Quest and I have

1234
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,720
to order the mercury quantitative so

1235
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,559
that I get an actual number. Otherwise,

1236
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,440
and if you ordered the whole panel, they

1237
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,440
just report less than four. Well, okay.

1238
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,760
I get worried if the mercury is getting

1239
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,680
at one and above. You know, I don't want

1240
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,760
to wait until it's already at four

1241
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,319
before I'm going to initiate some

1242
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,440
strategies like seafood avoidance and

1243
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:52,400
sulfor detox the mercury

1244
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:55,440
and labor does give a panel with uh

1245
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,800
cadmium mercury, lead and arsenic. And

1246
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,559
do they give the actual

1247
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,280
give the actual number? And also we got

1248
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:05,599
uh our metals tested by Great Plains on

1249
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:08,240
the Neutra Val in the study.

1250
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,920
Nice. Okay. Next one here is uh this is

1251
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,720
for you Cat because I know you deal with

1252
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,440
a lot of POTS. So this is a person who

1253
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,839
has POTS and has brain fog and mild

1254
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,760
memory loss. Um and the pharmacist told

1255
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,359
him AISEP was contraindicated. He's

1256
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:24,240
already being treated for tacoc cardia

1257
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,599
and POTS. What about medications? Um,

1258
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,880
again, this is something you're dealing

1259
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:28,480
with a lot.

1260
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,160
Well, you know, the POTS is again

1261
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,640
another multiffactorial thing. Well,

1262
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,119
we've seen a huge epidemic with COVID. I

1263
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:38,559
know I developed POTS after the first

1264
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:41,359
CO. So, I I'm very empathetic with that.

1265
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,720
Um, uh, so like all things, you've got

1266
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:44,559
to kind of address everything. What's

1267
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,400
the inflammation? What's the toxin

1268
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:51,839
burden? What's the um um, you know,

1269
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:55,200
burden of um of infections kind of

1270
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:57,119
thing. But um so there's not a single

1271
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:59,920
thing that's going to help mitigate the

1272
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:01,920
POTS. But one thing that I will say um

1273
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,960
from already doing all those things in

1274
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,920
myself was um oxytocin was personally

1275
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,040
helpful for me with POTS and you know

1276
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,200
oxytocin is a hormone uh they call it

1277
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:16,400
the love hormone or the bonding hormone

1278
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,160
but um there is some data with POTS and

1279
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:20,480
um it has to be ordered through a

1280
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:24,079
compounding pharmacy. I use Belmar

1281
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,400
Pharmacy for mine, but um but I have to

1282
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,760
say that personally for me was a help.

1283
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,240
So, I'll just throw that out there.

1284
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,000
That's a sample of one, but I tried it

1285
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,720
because of some data I found showing

1286
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,800
that it could be helpful for for POTS.

1287
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,640
Great. Then there's one question here

1288
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,880
about what percentage of the people

1289
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,160
needed treatment beyond lifestyle such

1290
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:47,200
as detox, gut, infection treatment, etc.

1291
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,440
I'm assuming it's 100%.

1292
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,040
Yeah, I think everybody is going and I

1293
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,960
think it's important to say this is not

1294
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,960
just lifestyle. We're actually getting

1295
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,880
at what's causing the problem and

1296
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,480
addressing those things. That's what

1297
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,480
gives you the best outcomes.

1298
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,920
I want to say something about that.

1299
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:07,599
Everybody got very similar lifestyle pro

1300
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:10,559
protocols, right? But beyond that,

1301
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,359
because of the very extensive amount of

1302
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:16,319
testing we did, every individual in this

1303
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,280
study got a different treatment protocol

1304
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:22,160
based on their specific results. What

1305
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,520
toxins did they have? What kind what

1306
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:28,800
level of of insulin uh problem did they

1307
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:31,040
have? Uh what were they exposed to

1308
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,200
micotoxins? You know, did they have mold

1309
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:38,079
in their living environment? How

1310
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:40,079
inflamed were they? Uh antio how how

1311
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,880
many antioxidants did they what

1312
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,720
intensity of antioxidants did they need?

1313
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,040
What vascular treatment did they need?

1314
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:49,839
Did they have clotting disorders and so

1315
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,480
they needed uh supplementation for that

1316
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:56,079
on and on and on. So each person's

1317
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,160
protocol was extensively individualized.

1318
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,839
Yeah, great point. So we got some good

1319
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,920
ones coming up here. I want to get

1320
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,440
through these that um why were the

1321
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,720
improvements in mocha similar between

1322
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,319
the control and treatment group. So

1323
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,040
that's a great question because this

1324
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:10,880
other the CNS vital signs is a much more

1325
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,119
sensitive test and was developed

1326
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,880
specifically. So it did not have a

1327
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,559
learning effect. Just just taking it a

1328
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,280
couple times doesn't make you better at

1329
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,720
it. So that was really helpful and you

1330
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:23,200
could see that you could see that in the

1331
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,760
in the uh control group. But you're

1332
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:29,280
absolutely right. In our first trial, we

1333
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:32,880
saw improvements in mocha in 84% of the

1334
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,559
people. And uh this time around, what we

1335
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,960
saw was yes, there was an improvement in

1336
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:38,480
the treated one, but there was a lesser,

1337
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,200
it was still an improvement. And the

1338
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:43,119
difference was a trend. It was at the

1339
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:45,760
0.154

1340
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:47,520
level. So it didn't reach 0.05. It was

1341
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,680
not statistically significantly

1342
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,480
different. There was a better in the

1343
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,319
control, lesser better in the treatment,

1344
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,559
lesser in the control. But they still

1345
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:58,079
have both improved. And I know Kat, you

1346
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,480
had one of your patients who told you

1347
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,960
why why she thought that was the case.

1348
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:06,240
Well, one of my patients that was in the

1349
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,559
delayed treatment cohort was also being

1350
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,960
followed at Stanford Neurology for her

1351
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,520
cognitive issues, and I didn't find out

1352
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,079
until the end of the study that they

1353
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:18,160
were testing her mocha regularly. So, I

1354
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,319
think she did the mocha test like seven

1355
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,720
or eight times in a nine-month trial.

1356
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:25,280
Well, she was a high IQ person. Even

1357
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,200
though her cognition was declining, she

1358
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,280
learned how to take that mocha. So,

1359
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,920
there was a practice effect. And one of

1360
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:34,319
the things that that I I will need to

1361
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:37,760
tease this out formally, but one of my

1362
00:54:34,319 --> 00:54:40,079
theories is I know in my cohort,

1363
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,839
everybody had, you know, at least

1364
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,520
college education and most of my

1365
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,520
patients had advanced degrees. So, we're

1366
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,520
talking about higher education, higher

1367
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:51,440
IQ people. and and I think that the

1368
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,720
learning effect on the mocha happens

1369
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:57,440
more readily in that kind of profile. Um

1370
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,520
so so that was our theory that that

1371
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,079
people were learning how to take the

1372
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,119
mocha. Um even though we used a

1373
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,040
different version. There's three

1374
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,280
versions of mocha A, B, and C. And we

1375
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,599
used A, B, C, and then we went back to A

1376
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,160
at the end. And one of my group B

1377
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:15,599
patients at the end remembered that she

1378
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:17,920
had taken that same version and you know

1379
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,000
recalling the animals and things on the

1380
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,160
test. So um so I think there was a

1381
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,119
learning effect but but let's just you

1382
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:27,599
know say that that was the only one of

1383
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,599
our cognitive markers that did not reach

1384
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,000
statistically

1385
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,800
significance between the two cohorts.

1386
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,280
every other marker we did have a a

1387
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,680
separation that reached a clear

1388
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,839
significance between A and B. I also

1389
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,920
think in this trial we had to do mocha

1390
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:46,720
remotely. We used a centralized

1391
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,920
neurosychologist trained raider to do it

1392
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,920
for all the patients. The

1393
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,760
neurosychologist did not know who was in

1394
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,319
group A or group B. So they were blinded

1395
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:56,799
to that. But there are problems I think

1396
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,760
in doing the mocha online especially

1397
00:55:56,799 --> 00:56:02,240
when your hearing is declining and you

1398
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,559
know that I feel like the mocha probably

1399
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:06,720
is more accurate if it's done locally

1400
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:10,160
but we tried to standardize it to have

1401
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:11,760
everyone um assessed by the same rider.

1402
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,200
Yeah, that's a great point and and I

1403
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:15,520
think it's important to point out when

1404
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,119
you are having cognitive decline you

1405
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,280
don't forget everything. So you may

1406
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,040
remember an old mocha it's that you have

1407
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,960
patchiness. So, and especially times

1408
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,960
under stress, times with poor, you know,

1409
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,119
you do more poorly under stress with

1410
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,280
times with poor sleep and on so forth

1411
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,720
and so on. So, you may have a problem,

1412
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,559
you know, you may ask the same thing

1413
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:34,079
three times at dinner, but at the same

1414
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,160
time, you may remember something from

1415
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,880
nine months ago. So, it's not that it's

1416
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,880
uniformly changed. And so, yes, there

1417
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,480
were people that did well. There was a

1418
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,200
what looked like a learning effect on

1419
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,119
the mocha in this case, but again, there

1420
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,960
they they still did better. They just

1421
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:52,240
didn't do so much better that it reached

1422
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,760
0.05. 05 it got to 0.154.

1423
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,079
Next one here is from Colleen who's

1424
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,799
asking what about if someone is in the

1425
00:56:56,079 --> 00:57:01,599
13 to 14 range on MOGA. So it's a great

1426
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:05,280
point and many people have seen as you

1427
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,200
pass that 16 on the way down lower it

1428
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:09,359
does get tougher. So I think the point

1429
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,119
is we've seen people at zeros who got

1430
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,440
back their continents and their

1431
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:16,079
discussion and talking. So the point

1432
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,400
here it's not that it's yes or no. it's

1433
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:21,760
that as you're going lower and lower,

1434
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:23,920
it's increasingly difficult to address

1435
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,000
all the things well enough. So, what

1436
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,920
happens is people kind of run out of gas

1437
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,760
if they're trying at the lower level.

1438
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,920
So, what I would consider for someone in

1439
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,520
the 13 to 14 range, and especially if

1440
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,040
they haven't had symptoms for too many

1441
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:37,599
years,

1442
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:40,160
please give it 6 to 12 months. Give it a

1443
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:41,760
try. You'll see they should bump up. We

1444
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,680
had someone who came in during the

1445
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,720
trial, not in the trial, but came in to

1446
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:49,119
Dr. Burke who had a mocha of seven. She

1447
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,799
got him up to a 13 and he was clearly

1448
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:54,240
doing better. His symptoms were better.

1449
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:55,680
He was better etc. So it happens but it

1450
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,839
is increasingly difficult. This

1451
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:00,960
particular person did have massive

1452
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:03,359
exposure as it turned out to micotoxins.

1453
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:05,119
So um try it for a while but you're

1454
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,000
absolutely right. If you're up in the

1455
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,079
20s it's much easier to get and sustain

1456
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,319
improvement than if you're down in the

1457
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:14,240
low teens. That's correct. And sometimes

1458
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:15,920
when people come in in the moderate

1459
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,160
Alzheimer range,

1460
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,200
um we can at least stabilize the

1461
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,480
decline.

1462
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:25,440
So we might get as much improvement as

1463
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,280
we see earlier on, but we can stabilize.

1464
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,200
So it's absolutely worth doing. And as

1465
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,799
mentioned, stay the course. So don't do

1466
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,720
it for a month and say this isn't

1467
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,640
helping. Like if you're going to going

1468
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:38,319
to try it, please try it. So it's long

1469
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:40,240
enough. Um excuse me. I have for an

1470
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:43,440
appointment that I was unable to change,

1471
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,119
but um I I see we have still lots of

1472
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:47,599
questions coming in. So, I'm hoping

1473
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:49,760
maybe we can repeat this and and just

1474
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:52,960
start by, you know, the ask me anything

1475
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:55,920
format and and and help to have more

1476
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,160
people understand what else. And um uh

1477
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,319
maybe you want to talk about the uh the

1478
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:03,200
mold testing that we did and how we

1479
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:04,960
incorporated that in in in the protocol

1480
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,359
because I think that's something that

1481
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,040
not enough people know about.

1482
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,880
Yeah. So, let's do this. I know you've

1483
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,559
got to run to your appointment and we

1484
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,920
we've run out of time here. It's the the

1485
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:17,599
hour is is passed. So, let's set up uh

1486
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:19,520
Ann, would it be okay with you if we set

1487
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:20,799
up a followup where we go through some

1488
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:22,559
of these wonderful questions? There are

1489
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,559
lot lots of excellent questions. The

1490
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,240
next one here is about PCA. Happy to

1491
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:29,040
discuss that. I would recommend to this

1492
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:31,440
person, contact uh Carrie Rutland, the

1493
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,839
the caregiver who who's working with PCA

1494
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,960
and Dr. Neil Nathan who's working with

1495
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,319
PCA and doing quite a nice job. Uh but

1496
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,960
there are, you know, there are dozens

1497
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:43,920
and dozens more here. So, let's set that

1498
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:45,440
up. um if it's okay with with Cad and an

1499
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,200
and let's answer some more of these

1500
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,960
questions because I do think there

1501
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,880
there's so much exciting work to come

1502
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,280
out of this and the implications for

1503
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,640
patient care and for avoidance of

1504
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,079
dementia is huge. So uh we'll end there.

1505
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,599
Thanks so much to everybody for the

1506
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,680
great questions and we look forward to

1507
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,040
talking to you next time. Uh we're we

1508
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,640
really are in a new era with this

1509
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,720
randomized control trial and

1510
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:08,160
congratulations once again to Dr.

1511
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,559
Hathaway and Dr. Tups for the

1512
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:14,000
outstanding outcomes. I just want to say

1513
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:17,280
one thing. There's two types of things

1514
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,599
where I have seen uh what seems like a

1515
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:22,799
miracle and that is when someone who's

1516
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,200
living in mold moves out of that mold.

1517
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,680
Yeah.

1518
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:29,280
That not always but sometimes. Second

1519
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:31,599
thing is sleep apnnea. I've gotten like

1520
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,720
three or four calls from spouses who

1521
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,520
say, "Oh my gosh, he's back or she's

1522
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:40,160
back when just their sleep apnea was

1523
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,559
treated." So, so we do see miracles

1524
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,319
sometimes. You know, in general, we

1525
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:46,240
treat everything. We're very aggressive

1526
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:47,920
about that. But, but there are some

1527
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,599
miracles.

1528
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:51,440
Great point. And, you know, Steven

1529
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,680
Gundry said to me one time that he still

1530
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,559
does what he does uh every day of the

1531
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,079
week because he's seeing things that 25

1532
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:59,760
years ago he would have considered a

1533
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:01,280
miracle. And he's seeing it again and

1534
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:03,200
again and again with people get better

1535
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,799
with their cardiac disease and their

1536
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:07,040
dementia and all these sorts of things.

1537
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,319
So, it's a it's an exciting new era. and

1538
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:10,799
we're all seeing these wonderful things.

1539
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,480
Kat, I know you got to run.

1540
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:14,480
Say thank you to everybody who joined

1541
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,440
us. Thank you so much for your interest

1542
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,119
and your support and um we're going to

1543
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,359
be trying to put, you know, more

1544
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,160
information out because of course we

1545
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:27,920
want everybody to know about these

1546
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:29,839
options and to not think they have no

1547
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,680
hope basically. I mean, I just think we

1548
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:32,880
we want people to come away feeling

1549
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:35,200
hopeful.

1550
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,720
Absolutely. All right. Any final words,

1551
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:39,280
Ann, that you want to mention?

1552
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,599
No. Uh, I'm I'm very grateful to have

1553
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,119
been a part of this uh this research and

1554
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:47,760
this whole program and I thank the

1555
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,520
people who who are interested enough to

1556
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,880
participate today. Thank you.

1557
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,720
Yeah. Thanks everybody. All right. Happy

1558
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:54,000
New Year to everyone and thanks again.

1559
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,280
We'll see you again.

1560
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,280
Thank you. Bye.

1561
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,280
Bye.
