because the difference has turned out to be greater than anything ever published. So, I want to make sure to point out this is not yet a peer-reviewed paper. It will come out as a peer-reviewed p paper later this year, but the results are so striking that we want people to be aware of them because there really is something that can be done now for cognitive decline as we've all been seeing now for over 10 years. But this was the best proof yet in the trial. So let me start. Uh Kat, you are the trialist among the group of the six sites, the one who has the most experience with trials and I know you've conducted over the years something like a hundred. Um tell me how many of the trials that you've done in the past led to cognitive improvement. Well, some of them did. I did all of the first generation of Alzheimer medication trials before the new anti-analoid drugs and some of them like Aerys did have some improvement but it didn't last beyond a year. So you could have you know a mild improvement but it wasn't sustained. And one of the thing and then then I actually did a study with one of the first anti-amaloid drugs years ago and we showed that that drug could wipe out the amaloid plaques but it did not translate to clinical improvement. So that drug never made it onto the market. So um so yeah, this is quite exciting to be involved in these two trials where we don't just slow things down, but we actually reverse what's happening by addressing all of the underlying causes. And that's that's the difference. I mean maybe medications can reduce amaloid plaques, but the process will keep going if you don't deal with the underlying drivers of the disease. Yeah, you made an important point which is sustainability. And so as you know Dr. Schneider from USC has published a paper saying what about the follow-ups on people who went on Aeris and unfortunately in the long run they did worse than people who weren't treated at all. So you're really essentially pushing things up to the front. You're frontloading but in the long run it's actually hurting you unfortunately. On the other hand you know we've published a paper showing people who even over 10 years continue to have sustained improvement. And so actually let me ask you an in your patients who've been treated for several years are you seeing sustained improvements in the patients who continue to follow the protocol and not everyone does of course right um but in the patients who continue to follow the protocol we see sustained improvement improvement that you know not not just stabilizes but they continue to improve you know not not really my patient personally, but Judy Benjamin is an incredible example of that. You know, not part of the study, but just an amazing uh an amazing result. We're seeing this again and again, and I just got an email from one of the people who's now been on eight years, and her scores are still going up. Uh her latest scores are better. Even though she was into the normal years ago, she's actually still getting better with her scores. So, that's that's great to see. So, let's talk about the the trial that's just been completed. Uh we'll have a paper coming out uh in the next several months as I mentioned, but meanwhile there is a free posted online preprint that you can see that describes all the details and summar summarizes uh what we saw in this trial. So, this was a randomized control trial. It was carried out at six different sites around um and you can see it on clinicaltrials.gov. So it is part of the the government online description of trials. Um it it was nine months. So people were randomized either to group A which was the precision medicine protocol or to group B which was standard of care. And essentially that meant going back to their PCP or their neurologist and having them do what they usually do, which I think is actually a good idea because we're all I think we've all been impressed with the fact that there's not a lot of treatment going on out there. There is some aerosept being used often. Um but in general, people aren't doing a lot and they're telling people, well, you're not that bad yet, you know, come back later. That sort of thing. And I've been horrified to see the sort of treatment that people are getting. In fact, our control group was very similar to the control group that was in some of the other trials that have been published. So, I think it's good. It helps us to match up with those trials. Also the degree of impairment was similar to other trials in that these were people who had MCI was the MCI stage or early dementia stage that is to say mocha scores of 18 or higher but with symptoms and with AQ21s. In other words, their partners had noticed that they were having problems as well. So for multiple different uh different analyses it was clear that there was impairment going on from symptoms from partners from their test scores all those sorts of things. Uh and then these were people who were treated for nine months and then looking at during that time what happened to their cognition, what happened to their epigenetics, what happened to their biochemistry, what happened to their physiology, all these sorts of things. Uh and so when we look at the end here, the striking thing was that the difference between the group that was in the control group that continue to go downhill with their memory, downhill with their overall cognitive scores versus the ones treated by Dr. Hathaway, Dr. Tups, um and the other four physicians um that I'll mention here, Dr. Craig Tanio, uh Dr. Christine Burke, Dr. Nate Bergman, Dr. David Hos uh all together those six sites um as an average they went up up up uh through the nine months. Very striking. So they had improvements in their overall cognition. They had improvements in their composite memory scores. They had improvements in their executive function. They had improvements in their processing speed. Really striking. They had improvements in their symptoms. Their partners noticed the improvement. This wasn't one of these things where it was so small that the partners didn't even notice it, which has happened in other trials in the past. These were clearly noticeable by the partners. So, by all criteria, these people were clearly better. Now, some much better, some a little better, but by all criteria, they were better. So, I think it's helpful sometimes to have an illustrative case or two. Um, Kat, can you mention I know you you in your I should mention in all your group, every single treated patient got better. That's unheard of in the Alzheimer's field. So, congratulations for that. Can you mention just one case as an example? Sure. And and let me say with every every patient getting better, um, all but one of my patients tested in a completely normal range by the end of the study. And I had people that started with mild Alzheimer's and then you know some with MCI but you know even those down to most of 20 21. So we had people coming from a place of very clear impairment into complete normalization. Now do they have further to go? Sure. As as uh Ann mentioned you know people can still keep getting better and better. And one thing I wanted to say was by doing the full court press we worked fast and furious because we only had nine months to move the needle. But what I saw in my cohort is a lot of people by three months had already made phenomenal gains. And so, you know, if you if you're working with everything at once, which is what we did, um, and give people the proper support, they can shift so quickly. So um I and my one patient that didn't test completely normal I would mention was still working on resolving mold issues in her home which we know is a neurotoxin and causes degeneration in the brain but she doubled her scores on her CNS vital signs neuroscychiatric battery. So she was still clearly improving. Um, I have one patient that is is such an interesting story because, um, not only did everything normalize for him cognitively. I mean, he scored a perfect score on his mocha at one point, but it also, um, resolved all of his medical and physical issues as well. This gentleman was scheduled to have three different joint replacements. He told me he could barely get up the stairs. He had to walk sideways and hold on because he had so much pain. Guess what? All those joints are normal now. He has no more pain. He doesn't need surgeries, joint replacement surgeries. What a a wonderful um side effect of our study. He also had autoimmune disease. He had my gravis which is a pretty serious autoimmune disease and basically we resolved all the symptoms of those and I was watching his antibbody levels come down um because of the treatment. Um, I believe we uh, you know, got them off of blood pressure medicines. And so, you know, the exciting thing is not only what we're doing is is turning around the cognition and helping people, you know, to to reclaim their their brain and their cognitive function, but it helps everything else because, of course, that's the whole premise of what we do, right? Everything's connected. The brain is connected to the body. So, as we address all of these drivers, they all help the brain and vice versa. Yeah, you know, you brought up a really good point, which is that people get better not just cognitively, but actually in the trial, we saw improved statistically significant improvements in systolic blood pressure, in diastolic blood pressure, in BMI, in homocyine, in hemoglobin A1C, in lipid profiles. So again and again and again we're seeing this improvement not just in the brain but also in physiology. It's really striking to see. Um Dr. Hathaway could you mention one of the patients who came through just an illustrative case um and what you saw. Yeah. Um, enthusiasm counts for a lot and all my patients were enthusiastic because we we look for that in in our selection, but uh my patients who were the most enthusiastic uh did the best. Uh my patient who lost 35 lbs, she got her ketones. Ketones was one of our uh one of the things that we asked people to do to get uh into ketosis, meaning a ketone level between 1 and four. This woman's ketones were 3.5 to four within a month of starting the protocol. She just she she just was um well, like I said, I think she was probably gifted in ketosis in some way. Some people struggle with that. Some people struggle with getting their glucose down. For some people, it's it's it's easy. Uh so each each individual each individual is is their own interesting challenge. But uh uh this particular woman who's an ApoE4, by the way, uh a homozygous for a4, she um lost, like I said, 35 pounds. She got rid of all of her joint pain, muscle aches, etc. that were keeping her from being able to exercise. She was enthusiastic about all aspects of exercise including the highintensity interval kind of exercise which is which is quite quite demanding. Um after she lost she quickly lost uh 20 pounds and then the other 15 came off slowly. uh she and her scores were just I I don't remember her exact scores. I wish I could tell you but her scores were were dramatically improved within 3 months and of course by 9 months they were they were really excellent. Uh she she was able to during the study which I did not encourage during the study she decided she was going to become a health coach and took a health coaching course. Yeah. She she was just amazing. Yeah. Yeah. you know, one of the earliest patients I had uh wrote back and said, you know, I have a new life now and um she started her new nonprofit. She went back to school. She just said, "Look, this is my new life now. I'm going to do all these things that I wasn't able to do before." So, it's great to see. So you mentioned the scores and I think you know there's a huge amount of data which is going to be one of the I think best outcomes from this that we'll be able to look at the epigenetics and and we'll be able to look at the imaging and we'll be able to look at all the different pieces all the biochemistry etc all the and the biomarkers of course these are all critical but one of the points I wanted to mention is that as you can imagine when these people started their average scores for their cognition were of course below average. So if you're looking at average for their age, most of the people that are making up the average don't have cognitive decline. So of course they were below that. But interestingly, at the conclusion, the ones who were treated were actually above the average, above the 50th percentile for people their age. That's 50th percentile for people who are not cognitively affected. just as Cat said a few minutes ago, her patients ended up being in the normal range for their cognition, which again is unheard of with these sorts of treatments. So that was uh very very exciting to see. And of course, the ones who were in the control group started out below average and went further downhill during that time. Um that brings up another key point here, which is the bounce. So the people who were in the control group but then after 9 months they were offered six months of free treatment so that they could get the benefit and we have just one uh so far just one site uh Dr. Craig Tanio who's reported his what happened before and you could see a beautiful they went down then they went up strikingly but Kat you made a really good point the other day which is that even waiting that nine months is not a good idea for these people because it makes it tougher. They're continuing that process and maybe if you could say something about your patients who were in group B the control but then switched over at the end of the nine months and began the treatment. What happened to them? Yeah. So my personal feeling is for starters we have showed you tremendous benefit in all measures of cognition with this study and so we know this works and I feel like the need to have a control group in the future should be done away with because I watched my patients decline that were not getting active treatment and then once they rolled over into the active treatment they did not improve as quickly. as my patients that I had gotten earlier in the process. So, I feel like, you know, the longer you wait while your brain is degenerating, the harder it's going to be to turn that ship around, you know. So, so they did improve. Absolutely. But, um, it wasn't as rapidly as the patients did in the other treatment group. It's a really good point and it really brings up the issue of ethics in standard control groups in in standard of care treatment control groups. And so I wonder whether there will end up being more use of historical controls because the historical controls you could see that you know they clearly went downhill. there's less of that as people are catching on and people are trying to do some of the things themselves and so the control groups tend to do a little bit better even though we saw that there was some decline overall they tend to do a little bit better than control groups from say 20 30 years ago so people are kind of catching on to this uh and what in your I know you're you're an expert in BHRT uh in bio identical hormone replacement how many of your patients ended up being treated that included bio identical hormones. Well, every woman who was in my study was treated with BHIP and of course, you know, I I certainly have spoken at great length in many uh in many different venues about the uh incredible power of uh estradile for brain health uh for cardiovascular health and for bone health. Uh and fortunately at this particular point in time uh menopausal hormone replacement is having a moment. Uh there's a lot more positive being written about it. They've talked about it. There's multiple books. you know the physicians, the women physicians who are uh you know the the number of women physicians has expanded tremendously and that group of women that that wave of women physicians is reaching their mid-40s now and they are all like we are not going to be putting up with no hormone replacement. We are going to be getting our our hormones and it's very important. I mean, there's so much that I could talk about that for two hours, but the the importance of using the right hormone, topical estradiol that's biioidentical and real progesterone is extremely important and also replacing testosterone at a low dose for women is also important. All of those things make a huge difference uh in terms of overall health and in terms of cognitive health. Yeah. And of course, the issue often comes up about age. In this trial, people were from 45 to 76. I can't remember if the highest one was 76 or 77, but it was one of those two. Uh and and the average age in this trial was 65. So, it was actually fairly similar. Now, we've all seen younger people. When I was training way back in the 1980s at UCSF, we never saw people in their 40s and 50s with Alzheimer's disease. It's a relatively common thing to see now. Uh so things have changed along the way. Um but in this particular case, the average age was 65. There were 50 patients who were in the treated group and there were 23 who were in the control group. It was originally meant to be 2:1. We got a couple of extras in the treatment. One we had a dropout uh in the other group. So uh some people would say, well, why wasn't it a thousand people? So here's why. When you have something that has a tiny tiny effect, you have to have a thousand or more patients because you won't have a statistically significant difference. So we started by calculating what is it going to take to see a statistically significant difference and the answer was between 50 and 60 people. So we ended up with 73. We wanted to go a little bit beyond that to make sure that we had that. The other factor here is this trial cost $6.6 6 million and we are truly grateful to Diana Mariam and the four winds foundation for the support of the trial. Other trials if you do a thousand people that will be an $80 million trial. There is actually one uh one treatment where now the trial costs have exceeded a billion. Hard to believe but there it does cost a lot of money to do these trials as you can imagine. And we, you know, you're generating large amount of data. You've got a lot of people involved. Uh, as we were going through this preprint, looking at all the acknowledgements and all the co-authors, you know, I realized how what a huge effort this this really does take a village. It really is a huge huge effort for years and thousands of hours on a lot of people's parts. So, yes, great to do one for a,000. Um, you know, if we come up with $80 million to do that, that would be a consideration. But the key here, and this is why the statistics are so important, is to do enough people to see if there's a statistically significant difference. And the answer is it's a huge difference. And in fact, the statistics were not at the 0.05 level, which is the standard accepted. Most of these differences were less than 0.0001. So a very high degree of significance for most of these uh trials. The processing speed was 0.01. So one out of a 100. So really striking striking differences. And Dale, excuse me. I think it's important to note that this is replicating our previous proof of concept, right? So this isn't a flash in the pan. This is replicating the results that we had in the first trial. And we've done even better in the responses in this trial than we did in the first trial, which already was exciting news that 84% of our patients got better. So now we're seeing even in some of the sites like mine, 100% of people had improvements. So um I think that's an important thing to note. Yeah, that's a great point. Uh so now you know the the evidence if you take all the evidence together there's a lot of anecdotal evidence multiple published um hundreds and hundreds of patients people are seeing this time and time again um then we have the trial that you mentioned the proof of concept trial where people the majority of people improve then there was a replication of that independently by Dr. Heather Sanderson and her group that saw virtually identical results and now we have a randomized controlled trial. So, you know, anyone can say I don't believe it. Um, but in fact, it's it is sometimes hard to believe because it's so much better outcomes than have been seen in the past. But it fits very much with what people are seeing every day. And we're now seeing also what it takes to get that. So let's talk about that for a moment because we see that the low compliance just as Dean Orish has had noted years ago with his cardiovascular work. Less compliance, less outcome, no big surprise. Better compliance, better outcome. But Ann, you mentioned a few years ago, you know, the compliance is not easy. You're you're doing something, but yet you've been able to put together a really fantastic team. So an what do you say to people to get the good compliance that you and your team get? Well, you have to work with these each individual. By the way, I I do want to mention that I did not do this alone with my group. I had a phenomenal uh nutritionist, Kia Sanford, a phenomenal health coach, Lynn K Phillips, and uh my Stacy Hawkins, my uh site coordinator, just phenomenal at their jobs. And so we uh worked with these people uh in the study who were already, you know, chosen because they were on board. they really wanted to to do it. Um, but we had very close communication between all of us as a team. When someone picked up, okay, some someone's fallen off here or there, we were on them immediately to help them correct course and get back into whatever whatever was the problem. you know, someone, you know, people developed um people fell and they had to see a a physical therapist uh and a massage therapist. And so, we would facilitate things like that to make sure that um we kept them as active as possible, as on track as possible with we we tracked so many things uh as a group. We tracked how much sleep they got, how much deep sleep, how much REM sleep, uh heart rate overnight, uh oxygen level overnight, etc. Um just as just as one example, you know, we we tracked their their diet very Kia tracked their diet extremely closely knowing, you know, why they were missing ketosis that day because they had all their they had their entire diet written down. our exercise code right we used chronometer that our nutritionists were able to literally get the information online we used a lot of different wearables and trackers in the study yeah or ring was very helpful um and heart math was very helpful for stress reduction um heart math has been was helpful in our first study helpful in this study we're we're very grateful grateful to them. Um and um ketosis was measured by a ketone a blood ketone meter on a regular basis. So there were a lot there was a lot of work and a lot of coordination between all the people on each of our teams to get this to get this to work. And uh some might say, well, wasn't that extremely expensive? And you know, our our answer is uh well, yes, it's it's it's expensive, but uh what's the cost of uh memory care, assisted living uh for a year once someone has dementia? uh it's a lot more than uh the cost of treating a patient in the early stages of uh mild cognitive impairment, early dementia compared to five years in uh you know memory care. Absolutely. Well, the thing with the coaching is you need the coaching to help get started and and get this program assimilated into your life, but you don't need it forever. That's not a forever cost. But we definitely learned from the first study that having the coaching and the support, nutrition support, exercise support, um diet, um uh just to help with integrating all the aspects of the protocol that helps people to shift very quickly. So um like in the first study, this study, every patient was assigned a nutritionist, a health coach, and an exercise coach. The exercise coaches were amazing and and I had people that never exercised a day in their life turn into regular exercisers because we did require that they exercise six days a week in this protocol and we tracked it. So um you know patients had to be motivated to be in the study because they had to have a certain level of compliance with every aspect of the of the protocol and if they were non-compliant we had to discharge them from the study. So that did help the motivation for people. But I I hope that that everybody else will be motivated by the results that we got to institute their own programs if they're having problems because uh it just made a huge difference. Yeah. I mean this really has told us we have to change to recognize that you know this something can be done. This is now really the first effective approach to cognitive decline. Please don't wait. you know, people should get evaluated, get on active prevention or early treatment because there's so much that can be done. And Kat, if you could say something, I know in the first trial you had a support group and it's been pointed out that support groups tend to help with getting even better outcomes. So, we can continue now to see what are the things that you add on to get better and better outcomes. If you could talk about a little bit about your support group. Yeah, right. We in the current trial we had a support group and um my health coach and nutritionist facilitated the support group. They met monthly. Um this was for the patients in the active treatment of course and then once the patients that were in the delayed treatment um crossed over into active treatment, they were able to join the group as well. People found that immensely supportive. um people that were further along in the program were able to help people that were just coming to it to let them know that oh maybe they struggled with ketosis or exercise or brain training. But um definitely that support of the patients I think probably was a factor of why my patients did well. Um so they really enjoyed that and we've just um secured funding that we're going to be able to continue that support group for our patients to stay the course. Right. So um so we'll probably be starting that next month. But both the patients and their study partner who was usually the spouse. So patients had to have a study partner to come into this trial for two reasons. One we validated that they had impairments in all these different areas. And so the study partner had to also with the rating scale, you know, um show us that that this patient was truly um struggling in certain areas of their life and their memory. Um so um so the study partners were needed for the rating scales, but they were needed to support their loved one to help implement this program daytoday as well. So both the patients and their study partners came to the support group. Great. And an could you speak to the issue that comes up often which is okay this is great for the few people that that will you will want to do this but if you have you know a hundred people who come to you on a you know just a day-to-day basis what percentage your just your guess what percentage are appropriate for getting into your protocol versus those that just say you know I I'm just not going to be able to do this. Um well the ones who end up talking to me in general are those who are interested. So yes I have you know uh for people who come in who make who who take the time to think about it make an appointment come in to get help with their diminishing cognition I would say 95% decide to uh at least go ahead and try the protocol and I would say 90% continue. Yeah. Fantastic. because of course we want to make this available to everyone possible and as you indicated look it's far less in terms of cost than going to a memory care facility and it's far less in cost actually than other therapeutic options um that are that are out there. So in fact there there are some real advantage and of course it's also more effective and fewer side effects and improving your overall health. So, it it's kind of a no-brainer that it's actually the the best thing going here for for many reasons. Uh we've got uh we've got some excellent questions here. So, let's let's start to go through some of these questions because there are so many good ones. Uh first one here is what's the best way to get started. There are a couple of ways. Uh one thing is just to go on my cqest.com. It's a free cognitive test and you can go from there because it does sneak up on you. There are a lot of people that think, well, I'm here. I'm really not having problems. and they'll find out no, they really are. The other possibility, take a look at the preprint. You'll see the six sites where this was done and contact one of the physicians like Dr. Hathaway or Dr. Tops or Dr. Tanio or Dr. Bergman or one of those people um and talk to them about uh you know whe what they're doing at the time, whether they're taking new patients etc. Um John here says what were the size of the group? So 50 in the treatment group, 23 in the control group. Next one here is uh Buck Institute had a trial about achieving ketosis. Uh yeah and and uh the the conceptual nature the looking at the inflammatory piece and the looking at the toxicity and looking at energetics mitochondrial support what molecules interact with a itself a remarkable look it's essentially that's amaloid precursor protein not everybody thank you I was gonna say that amaloid precursor protein is a is a receptor that sits in your neurons especially near synapses And it literally is a switch that's looking are you going toward connection? Are you going toward protection? So when when things are bad, you go toward protection and makes the amaloid which is an antimicrobial which kills herpes and kills various fungi and kills various bacteria. When things are good, you're making something called SAP alpha, soluble AP alpha. That's building new synapses. That's connection. So you got connection protection. all these people that we're seeing are on the protection side. We got to get them back over. We got to get rid of the things that are causing that. So, the Buck Institute is where the a lot of the conceptual nature of this came from. And of course, Dr. Hathaway uh and and Dr. Tubes are experts in functional medicine, which is the translational piece of this. How do you actually tell what's going on and and what to address? I think that's where we're headed. Now, as far as this particular trial you mentioned, which is for ketones only, you know, in general, we haven't found that single items are that beneficial as much as an overall precision medicine protocol. However, I'm interested in the results of the trial. We'll see. Um, it's important to point out though that whether or not any specific thing helped, it still may be part of an overall optimal protocol. That's that's the change in thinking that we all have to undergo. Dale, can I say something about in our trial? So, um, the requirement in our trial was that people achieve ketone levels of one to four, so kind of mild to moderate ketosis. And Dr. Hathaway mentioned her patient that went almost up to four very quickly. Most people don't do that. Um, but what we observed in the first trial was sometimes when people did go deeper into ketosis, they had additional benefits. Some people's brains light up with ketosis and other people don't notice as much. So, it's not a one-sizefits-all necessarily for everyone, but for the purposes of a study, we had to standardize what what people were doing with the diet. And I have to say uniformly, I did exit interviews with a lot of my patients and they would all say they had so much more energy. Their energy was um steady throughout the day. they didn't crave sugar, you know, so people all, you know, it's a shift for some people to really shift into ketosis if they're eating a lot of carbs in their diet, but but uniformly people appreciated the benefits of the ketosis. It's a great point. And as a neurologist, you know, we would look for to say that someone had Alzheimer's, we would look for a PET scan that showed reduced glucose utilization in the temporal and parietal loes. And so yes, you are in you are improving that by getting those ketones because now not only do they have the glucose which they're not utilizing well enough, but they've also they're getting better insulin sensitivity. So now the glucose is working better. Now they're getting the ketones as well. So they're becoming metabolically flexible. It's like a Prius that's run out of both fuels and now you got both fuels working again, which is why you see these tremendous improvements. So yeah, absolutely. tremendous weight loss in some of our patients that needed to lose weight. And of course, we found ways to support the people that were already thin and didn't need to lose weight, you know, with additional protein and collagen and, you know, things like that. But, um, but the tremendous weight loss for some of our patient and you mentioned 35 pounds, the gentleman that I spoke of that needed the three joint replacements lost 35 pounds as well, which helped. Interestingly, we had uh diagnosed his sleep apnoa and then the sleep apnnea got much better of course once he lost the 35 pounds. So um so yeah the ketosis part has has been an interesting thing for both of our protocols. But you brought up a really good point which is there is a difference between the person who comes in and wants to lose some weight and is does have some some extra atapost to lose versus the ones who are frail. there are people who are frail uh and so there is a difference there in the way you treat them to get the best outcomes. I would also mention the the APOE4 group is interested to say well wait a minute about half of the people that we had in this trial were APOE4 positive. There were six that were APOE4 homozygous. Um and then the rest of the half was uh was hetererozygous. Um and you the question was well did they do better or worse than the other? In our earlier trial we we did look at that and it turns out that they both had statistically significant improvements. Um so we and we do see on a daily basis people who are ApoE4 uh do very well on this protocol as well as other but we'll see we those are data we have not crunched yet so there is tons of stuff still to look at I'm interested particularly in the correlations the people who got metabolic improvements are they the ones that got the best cognitive improvements or not we have looked at the biioarkers and so we looked at a beta 42 to40 ratio GFAP P NFL and PTA 217 and let's say the A beta that he's talking about that's the amaloid levels. Great point. Yeah. So that's the amaloid ratios. So what was interesting was the GFAP which is the one that that that reflects the ongoing inflammation in the brain. Wait and say that's gal fibrillary acidic protein because these are concepts for a lot of people. Yeah, great great point. So yes, gal. So what this is actually it's a protein that is in your aststerytes not the neurons and what happens is as your astroytes are responding they're responding with inflammation and they're responding with attempted repair they will actually get bigger and there so they make this protein which is an intermediate filament protein in the astroite. you see as the aststerite balloons up and is now getting it's telling you you got active aststerytes in your brain because of inflammation and attempted repair. So the good news is it was statistically significantly improved in the treatment group and not in the other group. But with PAL what we found was something interesting and now others are seeing the same thing but initially we were not aware of this. When you lose weight your pal goes up without any change in your brain. you just see a pa when your when your weight goes up your pa is low. So you can imagine there were people where they would lose a lot of weight. They would do much better cognitively but their pal would actually shoot up as if they were having more problem. Now over the nine months they start to come down again. And so it did turn out that there was just barely significant an improvement in pa but it wasn't impressive. And I think that's partly because a lot of people in group A lost weight whereas we know that people in group B did not. In fact, they gained a little bit of weight um on the group B side. So I think that there's a bit of a compromise there in the PAL. Well, we might need to analyze that separately. It just occurred to me that we should look at the people who didn't gain weight, I mean didn't lose weight versus the people that lost weight and then see if we see a different signal there. I think one other interesting thing Dale was about the amaloid that um you know we found that all but two of the patients were positive with the levels of amaloid which was pretty interesting. The vast majority of these people had had the am the the amaloid related Alzheimer process occurring in their brain. Now that doesn't say that they didn't have some louisi bodies there. uh about 60% of people who end up with Alzheimer's at autopsy will have some louisi bodies as well. So there can be multiple processes as we're understanding these much more from the physiological side instead of the pathological side. Oh, you know there's some bad stuff get rid of it. No, why is it there? As we're understanding that we we now are beginning to understand that there are certain pathogens that are targeted by amalloid and certain pathogens that are targeted by alphasuclean. So for example, alphasuclean tends to be good at killing E.coli. It tends to be good at killing staff orius. Uh amalloid beta tends to be good at killing herpes simplex. So this is beginning to tell us what's going on in the brain. And it's not so surprising that in fact that you'll often have these multiple things. You have the PTA, you have the amaloid, you have the alphasuclean, and you also have the TDP43 which is another response like amaloid. And TDP43 tends to be something that responds to viruses that get into your cells. So we're now beginning to understand this whole process more from the physiological response side than from this old idea of there's something bad, get rid of it. Segue the test. I mean, this was important because because what you're hearing is we have these markers that are, you know, of things accumulating in the brain with Alzheimer's and neurodeenerative processes. But the thinking now is that they are antimicrobial. So they they can they can happen in response to toxins but also infections. So one of the things that we did in this study is we tested a whole battery of infections. And these become our treatment targets when they're positive is to to help um to work to reduce the burden of all these infections in people. And for those people who know that um HSV1 herpes simplex virus type one is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease. Uh it makes sense that bec if you have untreated uh high HSV1 in your body and in your brain your body's then going to make more amaloid which then is going to go ahead and start do more destruction in your brain. So that's we treated many viruses but especially we look for HSV1 and and treat that. And of course now we just found out in the last year right that there's a huge correlation with multiple sclerosis with other immune disorders because of the of the viruses but it's always been part of our paradigm with the treatments that we do. Tests for these infections support the immune system because when you have viruses they activate the immune system and then immune problems release all kinds of inflammatory chemicals that can you know further the neurodeeneration. So I think one question Dale that I can imagine people are saying well what do we do about the herpes since that is such a big big thing and I would say most of us treated our patients with um with valicyclo which is a wellknown antiviral approved for long-term use with herpes. So we did um treat with that and then follow their um antibbody their tighter levels of the herpes and um you know we still don't really know how long you need to treat that that uh that's still being learned about but um that is something we did I think pretty much all the investigators used bell cycle there for herpes and this comes right back to the idea of a comprehensive protocol as you know a paper just recently appeared showing that if you just treat you just take people with Alzheimer's and you just treat them with valet cyclloe. The hope was oh it's going to go away. No, they actually did worse than control if you just used that alone. And I suspect that's because now you're getting in and you're creating more inflammation as they're trying to mop this stuff up. So, you know what? You've got to do the whole thing. You've got to use it all together as a precision medicine or functional medicine or systems medicine approach. We've got a lot of good questions here and I know we're running out of time. So, let's go through some more of these questions. So, one was when testing for lime, the pre-publication said you used what specific panel or tests did you test for? Um we uh tested the uh lime immunolot for both borellia which is a classic lime as well as burellia miamotoy which is um relapsing tick fever that is common in some of our areas like here in California. So we tested amino for those. We tested the fish test um fluorescent immunino hybridization something or other forum besia and bartinella and um those were the main panels that we did with ienics. The rest of the co- infections like anoplasma or lichia we used or labcore testing that's at quest and labcore. Um and then all the viruses that we tested were also through lab core. We tested herpes, we tested cytogalo virus, myopplasma, toxoplasmos, toxoplasma. Um I'm probably HSV6 HHV6. Yes. Um so anoplasma Ioplasma. Yeah. So yeah, so a lot of these tests we were able to get through commercially available, you know, lab companies that and and I'll just say one trick for clinicians that are listening. Um because I I can get, you know, most of this stuff covered to people's insurance, but I always put 10 diagnosis codes. So I try to tell the story of why I need all these tests and uh and they generally can can get covered in the workup for people. Yeah. Igenics uh accepts Medicare. They accept Medicare and they added one commercial insurer. I mean it's a barrier with hygienics because it's expensive and so you know it is difficult for people to get the proper testing there. But yes for Medicare again with the proper diagnosis codes you can get testing covered on Medicare but as as you know we heard we're seeing people earlier and earlier with with cognitive decline and so they don't all have Medicare. Yeah. There's a question here from an about NeuroQ. Um, and full disclosure, I was involved in creating it. So, please understand that. All I can say, it's got six different components in it. It addresses some of the things we've talked about, but supplements are supplementary. I think that's the most important point to realize. All supplements are supplementary. You've got to get at the fundamentals. The great news is we now have we now have a foundation. So, we can now begin to add what happens if you add stem cells. What happens if you add intraasal peptides? What happens if you add these things? We've got a foundation that we know and we've proved works. Uh question here about Louisibody disease. This is a great question. Louibody disease is a close cousin of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. You have the alpha suclean that you make in Parkinson's, but you have the cognitive change that is very similar to Alzheimer's with some some differences often with some visual hallucinations and things like that. So when and we do see people on this protocol do well with Louisibody disease, but you really have to focus in on the toxic part. Cat was just talking about toxins and how important it is to look for these. They kind of three different types. The inorganics, uh, things like air pollution and mercury, the organics, things like tuine and benzene and and microlastics and anesthetic agents. And then it's the biotoxins, the things like triccoins and okrtoxin A and things like that. And by the way, translate he's talking about mold. Yeah, mold related toxins. And this OTAA, the okra toxin A is actually one that specifically damages the hippocample neurons. So that's a particularly important one. Uh so yeah, so that that's the situation. Please, if you're dealing with Louis body disease, make sure to see someone who is really good with dealing with toxins like Dr. Hathaway or Dr. Tubes. Let's say what we we did as far as the testing for toxins. So, we did um panels um with real-time labs for chemical toxins and we also did a panel with them for micotoxins. In our first study, we used what's now Mosaic Labs. It was Great Plain Labs. Um, so they also do testing for both of these. And they did not have both panels available at the time we started the study. But both of those companies will do panels for both micotoxins and chemical toxins. And then we tested heavy metals through LabCore. So Quest and Labcore. And you can get blood levels of, you know, mercury and cadmium and lead and arsenic, which is what we did. And I would just say a caveat again to the clinicians. If you're testing for mercury, I I know I use Quest and I have to order the mercury quantitative so that I get an actual number. Otherwise, and if you ordered the whole panel, they just report less than four. Well, okay. I get worried if the mercury is getting at one and above. You know, I don't want to wait until it's already at four before I'm going to initiate some strategies like seafood avoidance and sulfor detox the mercury and labor does give a panel with uh cadmium mercury, lead and arsenic. And do they give the actual give the actual number? And also we got uh our metals tested by Great Plains on the Neutra Val in the study. Nice. Okay. Next one here is uh this is for you Cat because I know you deal with a lot of POTS. So this is a person who has POTS and has brain fog and mild memory loss. Um and the pharmacist told him AISEP was contraindicated. He's already being treated for tacoc cardia and POTS. What about medications? Um, again, this is something you're dealing with a lot. Well, you know, the POTS is again another multiffactorial thing. Well, we've seen a huge epidemic with COVID. I know I developed POTS after the first CO. So, I I'm very empathetic with that. Um, uh, so like all things, you've got to kind of address everything. What's the inflammation? What's the toxin burden? What's the um um, you know, burden of um of infections kind of thing. But um so there's not a single thing that's going to help mitigate the POTS. But one thing that I will say um from already doing all those things in myself was um oxytocin was personally helpful for me with POTS and you know oxytocin is a hormone uh they call it the love hormone or the bonding hormone but um there is some data with POTS and um it has to be ordered through a compounding pharmacy. I use Belmar Pharmacy for mine, but um but I have to say that personally for me was a help. So, I'll just throw that out there. That's a sample of one, but I tried it because of some data I found showing that it could be helpful for for POTS. Great. Then there's one question here about what percentage of the people needed treatment beyond lifestyle such as detox, gut, infection treatment, etc. I'm assuming it's 100%. Yeah, I think everybody is going and I think it's important to say this is not just lifestyle. We're actually getting at what's causing the problem and addressing those things. That's what gives you the best outcomes. I want to say something about that. Everybody got very similar lifestyle pro protocols, right? But beyond that, because of the very extensive amount of testing we did, every individual in this study got a different treatment protocol based on their specific results. What toxins did they have? What kind what level of of insulin uh problem did they have? Uh what were they exposed to micotoxins? You know, did they have mold in their living environment? How inflamed were they? Uh antio how how many antioxidants did they what intensity of antioxidants did they need? What vascular treatment did they need? Did they have clotting disorders and so they needed uh supplementation for that on and on and on. So each person's protocol was extensively individualized. Yeah, great point. So we got some good ones coming up here. I want to get through these that um why were the improvements in mocha similar between the control and treatment group. So that's a great question because this other the CNS vital signs is a much more sensitive test and was developed specifically. So it did not have a learning effect. Just just taking it a couple times doesn't make you better at it. So that was really helpful and you could see that you could see that in the in the uh control group. But you're absolutely right. In our first trial, we saw improvements in mocha in 84% of the people. And uh this time around, what we saw was yes, there was an improvement in the treated one, but there was a lesser, it was still an improvement. And the difference was a trend. It was at the 0.154 level. So it didn't reach 0.05. It was not statistically significantly different. There was a better in the control, lesser better in the treatment, lesser in the control. But they still have both improved. And I know Kat, you had one of your patients who told you why why she thought that was the case. Well, one of my patients that was in the delayed treatment cohort was also being followed at Stanford Neurology for her cognitive issues, and I didn't find out until the end of the study that they were testing her mocha regularly. So, I think she did the mocha test like seven or eight times in a nine-month trial. Well, she was a high IQ person. Even though her cognition was declining, she learned how to take that mocha. So, there was a practice effect. And one of the things that that I I will need to tease this out formally, but one of my theories is I know in my cohort, everybody had, you know, at least college education and most of my patients had advanced degrees. So, we're talking about higher education, higher IQ people. and and I think that the learning effect on the mocha happens more readily in that kind of profile. Um so so that was our theory that that people were learning how to take the mocha. Um even though we used a different version. There's three versions of mocha A, B, and C. And we used A, B, C, and then we went back to A at the end. And one of my group B patients at the end remembered that she had taken that same version and you know recalling the animals and things on the test. So um so I think there was a learning effect but but let's just you know say that that was the only one of our cognitive markers that did not reach statistically significance between the two cohorts. every other marker we did have a a separation that reached a clear significance between A and B. I also think in this trial we had to do mocha remotely. We used a centralized neurosychologist trained raider to do it for all the patients. The neurosychologist did not know who was in group A or group B. So they were blinded to that. But there are problems I think in doing the mocha online especially when your hearing is declining and you know that I feel like the mocha probably is more accurate if it's done locally but we tried to standardize it to have everyone um assessed by the same rider. Yeah, that's a great point and and I think it's important to point out when you are having cognitive decline you don't forget everything. So you may remember an old mocha it's that you have patchiness. So, and especially times under stress, times with poor, you know, you do more poorly under stress with times with poor sleep and on so forth and so on. So, you may have a problem, you know, you may ask the same thing three times at dinner, but at the same time, you may remember something from nine months ago. So, it's not that it's uniformly changed. And so, yes, there were people that did well. There was a what looked like a learning effect on the mocha in this case, but again, there they they still did better. They just didn't do so much better that it reached 0.05. 05 it got to 0.154. Next one here is from Colleen who's asking what about if someone is in the 13 to 14 range on MOGA. So it's a great point and many people have seen as you pass that 16 on the way down lower it does get tougher. So I think the point is we've seen people at zeros who got back their continents and their discussion and talking. So the point here it's not that it's yes or no. it's that as you're going lower and lower, it's increasingly difficult to address all the things well enough. So, what happens is people kind of run out of gas if they're trying at the lower level. So, what I would consider for someone in the 13 to 14 range, and especially if they haven't had symptoms for too many years, please give it 6 to 12 months. Give it a try. You'll see they should bump up. We had someone who came in during the trial, not in the trial, but came in to Dr. Burke who had a mocha of seven. She got him up to a 13 and he was clearly doing better. His symptoms were better. He was better etc. So it happens but it is increasingly difficult. This particular person did have massive exposure as it turned out to micotoxins. So um try it for a while but you're absolutely right. If you're up in the 20s it's much easier to get and sustain improvement than if you're down in the low teens. That's correct. And sometimes when people come in in the moderate Alzheimer range, um we can at least stabilize the decline. So we might get as much improvement as we see earlier on, but we can stabilize. So it's absolutely worth doing. And as mentioned, stay the course. So don't do it for a month and say this isn't helping. Like if you're going to going to try it, please try it. So it's long enough. Um excuse me. I have for an appointment that I was unable to change, but um I I see we have still lots of questions coming in. So, I'm hoping maybe we can repeat this and and just start by, you know, the ask me anything format and and and help to have more people understand what else. And um uh maybe you want to talk about the uh the mold testing that we did and how we incorporated that in in in the protocol because I think that's something that not enough people know about. Yeah. So, let's do this. I know you've got to run to your appointment and we we've run out of time here. It's the the hour is is passed. So, let's set up uh Ann, would it be okay with you if we set up a followup where we go through some of these wonderful questions? There are lot lots of excellent questions. The next one here is about PCA. Happy to discuss that. I would recommend to this person, contact uh Carrie Rutland, the the caregiver who who's working with PCA and Dr. Neil Nathan who's working with PCA and doing quite a nice job. Uh but there are, you know, there are dozens and dozens more here. So, let's set that up. um if it's okay with with Cad and an and let's answer some more of these questions because I do think there there's so much exciting work to come out of this and the implications for patient care and for avoidance of dementia is huge. So uh we'll end there. Thanks so much to everybody for the great questions and we look forward to talking to you next time. Uh we're we really are in a new era with this randomized control trial and congratulations once again to Dr. Hathaway and Dr. Tups for the outstanding outcomes. I just want to say one thing. There's two types of things where I have seen uh what seems like a miracle and that is when someone who's living in mold moves out of that mold. Yeah. That not always but sometimes. Second thing is sleep apnnea. I've gotten like three or four calls from spouses who say, "Oh my gosh, he's back or she's back when just their sleep apnea was treated." So, so we do see miracles sometimes. You know, in general, we treat everything. We're very aggressive about that. But, but there are some miracles. Great point. And, you know, Steven Gundry said to me one time that he still does what he does uh every day of the week because he's seeing things that 25 years ago he would have considered a miracle. And he's seeing it again and again and again with people get better with their cardiac disease and their dementia and all these sorts of things. So, it's a it's an exciting new era. and we're all seeing these wonderful things. Kat, I know you got to run. Say thank you to everybody who joined us. Thank you so much for your interest and your support and um we're going to be trying to put, you know, more information out because of course we want everybody to know about these options and to not think they have no hope basically. I mean, I just think we we want people to come away feeling hopeful. Absolutely. All right. Any final words, Ann, that you want to mention? No. Uh, I'm I'm very grateful to have been a part of this uh this research and this whole program and I thank the people who who are interested enough to participate today. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks everybody. All right. Happy New Year to everyone and thanks again. We'll see you again. Thank you. Bye. Bye.
