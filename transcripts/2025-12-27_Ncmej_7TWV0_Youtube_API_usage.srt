00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,279
Hi, I'm Alan. I'm owner of a healthy

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,880
YouTube channel with over 900,000

3
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,400
subscribers.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,679
So, uh, this is my N workflow that

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,439
monitors comments on my videos. So, it

6
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:23,600
fetches new comments. So, he searchs for

7
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,600
the last published video here using this

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,600
API.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:35,760
After that, get the video ID

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,239
and search for comments

11
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:42,600
in this video.

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,600
So, it fetches new comments,

13
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,920
sends send them to the DeepSc AI for

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,920
response generation.

15
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,719
This is the filter for the nonresponded

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:04,280
comments.

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,280
classify and prepare the answers.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,840
So some of the comments are responded

19
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,799
based on the content of the message of

20
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,640
the comment and other ones they are sent

21
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,119
to the

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,119
to a AI agent to answer them.

23
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,400
This is in Portuguese. So answer this

24
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,840
comment in a personalized manner and

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,880
also useful. So it must generate a

26
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,400
genuine emp and pic and professional

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,240
response

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:51,159
but do not be so specific in the answer

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,159
especially in polymic themes.

30
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,759
Okay. So, I'm going to run this to so

31
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,759
you can see how it goes.

32
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,399
This Python script uh downloads

33
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,599
transcripts from my own videos using the

34
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,599
YouTube captions API.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,200
In this case, we have already downloaded

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
228

37
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,959
transcripts.

38
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,319
So in this run, we didn't got get any

39
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:36,360
new video new any transcripts. I'm going

40
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,360
to show the the transcripts folder.

41
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:46,040
So uh here we have the so we have all

42
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,040
the files from the transcripts.

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:56,560
So this workflow detects new videos and

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,440
sends the links to my WhatsApp

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,440
health community groups.
